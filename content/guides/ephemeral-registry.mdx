# Ephemeral Registry

The **ephemeral registry** is a temporary registry for your Depot builds. It allows you to easily save your build, then pull it back later, without needing to push to another registry. Additionally you can choose to push your build directly from the ephemeral registry to your own registry.

Builds saved in the ephemeral registry are currently persisted for **7 days**, after which time they are deleted. The cost of ephemeral registry storage is part of our the $0.10/GB storage pricing (see [pricing](/pricing)).

## Saving

To save a Depot build in the ephemeral registry, use the `--save` flag when running `depot build`:

```bash
depot build --save --metadata-file=build.json ...
```

The `--metadata-file` flag is optional, but it's useful for capturing the metadata about the build, such as the build ID and project ID. You can use build ID property in that file to pull or push the build later.

```json
{
  "depot.build": {
    "buildID": "your-build-id",
    "projectID": "your-project-id"
  }
}
```

For example, you could pull the image by the build ID in the metadata file via the `depot pull` command:

```bash
depot pull $(cat build.json | jq -r .\[\"depot.build\"\].buildID)
```

If you are using GitHub Actions with the `depot/build-push-action`, you can add `save: true` as an input:

```yaml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    save: true
    project: <your-project-id>
```

To pull the image back or push it to another registry, you will need the build ID. The build ID is printed in the output of `depot build` and is automatically set as an output of the `depot/build-push-action`:

```yaml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  id: build
  with:
    save: true
    project: <your-project-id>

- name: Print build ID
  run: echo ${{ steps.build.outputs.build-id }}
```

## Pulling

To pull a build that has been saved in the ephemeral registry, you can use the `depot pull` command with the build ID, and the `-t` flag to choose the image name/tag:

```bash
depot pull <build-id> -t <image-name>:<tag>
```

You can also omit the `<build-id>` argument to display an interactive list of builds to choose for pulling.

## Pushing

To push a build that has been saved in the ephemeral registry to your own registry, you can use the `depot push` command with the build ID, and the `-t` flag to choose the image name/tag:

```bash
depot push <build-id> -t <image-name>:<tag>
```

Some notes:

1. Like adding the `--push` flag to `depot build`, the `depot push` command uses registry credentials stored in Docker when pushing to registries. If you have not already authenticated with your registry, you should do so with `docker login` before running `depot push`.

2. Similar to `depot pull`, you can omit the `<build-id>` argument to display an interactive list of builds to choose from.

3. `depot push` will push the image to the target registry directly from the remote infrastructure, without downloading it to the CLI first, to avoid unnecessary data transfer.

## Example use-cases

There are a few common use-cases for the ephemeral registry:

- **Pulling a build to your local machine** - If you are building an image on Depot, but want to test it locally before pushing it to a registry, you can save the build in the ephemeral registry, then pull it down to your local machine to test it without having to rerun a build.
- **Integration testing a built image** - If you are running a set of matrix integration tests on your final image across multiple CI workflows, ephemeral registries can save you needing to run a build for each workflow. Instead, you can run a single build, save it in the ephemeral registry, then pull it down to each workflow to run the integration tests.
- **Working with large images** - The layer blobs in a Docker image can be quite large when working with large images. It can be time consuming to pull and push them down from a single builder. The ephemeral registry leverages a global CDN to distribute layer blobs to registries and when you run `depot pull`. This distribution mechanism makes it much faster to quickly pull and push large images.
