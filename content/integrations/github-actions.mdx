## Authentication

For GitHub Actions, you can use OIDC, project, or user access tokens for authenticating your build with Depot. Because GitHub Actions supports the OIDC flow, we recommend using that for the best experience.

### [OIDC token](/docs/cli/authentication#oidc-trust-relationships)

The easiest option is to use [GitHub's OIDC token](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/about-security-hardening-with-openid-connect) as authentication for `depot build`. Our [`depot/build-push-action`](#option-1--depot-build-and-push-action) & [`depot/bake-action`](#option-2--depot-bake-action) supports authentication via OIDC.

### [Project token](/docs/cli/authentication#project-tokens)

You can inject a project access token into the Action workflow for `depot` CLI authentication. Project tokens are tied to a specific project in your organization and not a user.

### [User access token](/docs/cli/authentication#user-access-tokens)

You can inject a user access token into the Action workflow for `depot` CLI authentication. User tokens are tied to a specific user and not a project. Therefore, it can be used to build all projects across all organizations that the user can access.

## Configuration

### Option 1 — Depot build and push action

We publish a GitHub Action ([depot/build-push-action](https://github.com/depot/build-push-action)) that implements the same inputs and outputs as [docker/build-push-action](https://github.com/docker/build-push-action) but uses the `depot` CLI to run the Docker build.

```yaml showLineNumbers
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    # Set permissions if you're using OIDC token authentication
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      # The depot CLI still needs to be available in your workflow
      - uses: depot/setup-action@v1
      - uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: |
            ...
          # Pass project token or user access token if you're not using OIDC token authentication
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
```

### Option 2 — Depot bake action

Another option is to make use of the GitHub Action ([depot/bake-action](https://github.com/depot/bake-action)) that
allows you to build all of the images defined in an HCL, JSON or Docker Compose file. Bake is a great action to use when you are looking to build multiple images with a single build request.

```yaml showLineNumbers
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    # Set permissions if you're using OIDC token authentication
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Bake Docker images
        uses: depot/bake-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          files: docker-bake.hcl
```

### Option 3 — Depot CLI

You can also use the GitHub Action ([depot/setup-action](https://github.com/depot/setup-action)) that installs the `depot` CLI to run Docker builds directly from your existing workflows.

_Note: This GitHub Action does not support the OIDC token authentication method._

```yaml showLineNumbers
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-20.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: depot/setup-action@v1
      - run: depot build --project <your-project-id> --push --tag repo/image:tag .
        env:
          DEPOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
```

## Examples

### Basic build and push to DockerHub with OIDC token exchange

This example uses our recommended way of authenticating builds from GitHub Actions to Depot via [OIDC trust relationships](/docs/cli/authentication#oidc-trust-relationships). It builds an image with a tag to be pushed to DockerHub.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      id-token: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
```

### Basic build and push with Depot API tokens

This example uses the `token` input for our `depot/build-push-action` to authenticate builds from GitHub Actions to Depot. Of course, the `token` input can be a user token. Still, we recommended using a [project token](/docs/cli/authentication#project-tokens) to limit the token's scope to a single project.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
```

### Build multi-platform images natively without emulation

This example shows how you can use the `platforms` input to build a multi-platform image for Intel and Arm architectures natively without emulation.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
          push: true
          tags: user/app:latest
```

### Build and push an image to Amazon ECR

Use the `configure-aws-credentials` and `amazon-ecr-login` actions from AWS to configure GitHub Actions to authenticate to your ECR registry. Then build and push the image to your ECR registry using the `depot/build-push-action`.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      # Login to ECR
      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1.6.1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: <aws-region>

      - name: Login to Amazon ECR
        id: ecr-login
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1.5.0

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.ecr-login.outputs.registry }}/<your-app>:latest
```

### Build and push an image to GCP Artifact Registry

Use the `setup-gcloud` action from GCP to configure `gcloud` in GitHub Actions to authenticate to your Artifact Registry. Then build and push the image to your GCP registry using the `depot/build-push-action`.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      # Login to Google Cloud registry
      - uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v0.6.0
        with:
          project_id: gcp-project-id
          service_account_key: ${{ secrets.GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}

      - name: Configure docker for GCP
        run: gcloud auth configure-docker

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          push: true
          tags: <gcp-region>-docker.pkg.dev/<gcp-project-id>/<your-app>:latest
```

### Build and push to multiple registries

Build and tag an image to push to multiple registries by logging into each one individually.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Configure AWS Credentials
        uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v1.6.1
        with:
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          aws-region: <aws-region>

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Login to Amazon ECR
        id: ecr-login
        uses: aws-actions/amazon-ecr-login@v1.5.0

      - name: Build and push
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          push: true
          tags: |
            <docker-hub-organization>/<your-app>:latest
            ${{ steps.ecr-login.outputs.registry }}/<your-app>:latest
```

### Export an image to Docker

By default, like `docker buildx`, Depot doesn't return the built image to the client. However, for cases where you need the built image in your GitHub Actions workflow, you can pass the `load: true` input, and Depot will return the image to the workflow.

```yaml
name: Build image

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  docker-image:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Depot CLI
        uses: depot/setup-action@v1

      - name: Login to DockerHub
        uses: docker/login-action@v2
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Build and load
        uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
        with:
          # if no depot.json file is at the root of your repo, you must specify the project id
          project: <your-depot-project-id>
          token: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_PROJECT_TOKEN }}
          load: true
          tags: test-container

      - name: Run integration test with built container
        run: ...
```
