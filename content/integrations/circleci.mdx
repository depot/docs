# CircleCI

## Authentication

For CircleCI, you can use project or user access tokens for authenticating your build with Depot. We recommend using project tokens as they are scoped to the specific project and are owned by the organization.

**Note:** The CLI looks for the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable by default. For both token options, you should configure this variable for your build environment via a [project environment variable](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).

### [Project token](/docs/cli/authentication#project-tokens)

You can inject a project access token into your CircleCI workflow for `depot` CLI authentication. Project tokens are tied to a specific project in your organization and not a user.

### [User access token](/docs/cli/authentication#user-access-tokens)

You can also inject a user access token into your CircleCI workflow for `depot` CLI authentication. User tokens are tied to a specific user and not a project. Therefore, it can be used to build all projects across all organizations that the user has access.

## Configuration

To build a Docker image from CircleCI, you must set the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable in your project settings. This is done through the [UI for your project](https://circleci.com/docs/set-environment-variable/#set-an-environment-variable-in-a-project).

CircleCI has two executor types that allow you to build Docker images. The `machine` executor runs your job on the entire VM with `docker` pre-installed. The `docker` executor runs your job in a container. Depot can be used in either executor type.

### Using the CircleCI machine executor

To install `depot` and run a Docker image build in CircleCI, add the following to your `config.yml` file:

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1
jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    resource_class: medium
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build with Depot
          command: |
            depot build .
```

### Using the CircleCI docker executor

If you would prefer to use the `docker` executor, you can use the following configuration:

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    docker:
      - image: cimg/node:lts
    resource_class: small
    steps:
      - checkout
      - setup_remote_docker
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build with Depot
          command: depot build .

workflows:
  run_build:
    jobs:
      - build
```

**Note:** The `setup_remote_docker` step is required for the `docker` executor if you want to execute Docker commands in your build before or after the `depot` CLI builds your image. See the examples below

## Examples

The examples below use the machine executor. However, the same commands can be used with the docker executor as well.

### Build multi-platform images without emulation in CircleCI

This example shows how you can use the `--platform` flag to build a multi-platform image for Intel and Arm architectures natively without emulation.

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    resource_class: medium
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build multi-architecture image
          command: |
            depot build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .
workflows:
  run_build:
    jobs:
      - build
```

### Build and push to Docker Hub

This examples assumes you have set the `DOCKERHUB_PASS` and `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` environment variables in your CircleCI project settings.

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    resource_class: medium
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build and push to Docker Hub with Depot
          command: |
            echo "$DOCKERHUB_PASS" | docker login -u "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" --password-stdin
            depot build -t <your-docker-hub-repository> --push .
workflows:
  run_build:
    jobs:
      - build
```

### Build and push to Amazon ECR

This examples assumes you have set the `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_ECR_REGISTRY_ID` environment variables in your CircleCI project settings. See the [`circleci/aws-ecr` orb documentation](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/circleci/aws-ecr) for more information.

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1
orbs:
  aws-ecr: circleci/aws-ecr@8.2.1

jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    resource_class: medium
    steps:
      - checkout
      - aws-ecr/ecr-login:
          region: us-east-1
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build and push to Amazon ECR with Depot
          command: |
            depot build -t <your-amazon-ecr-repo> --push .
workflows:
  run_build:
    jobs:
      - build
```

### Build and load the image back into the CircleCI job for testing

You can use the [`--load` flag](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) to download the built container image into the workflow.

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    resource_class: medium
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build and push to Docker Hub with Depot
          command: |
            depot build --load .
workflows:
  run_build:
    jobs:
      - build
```

### Build and load the image back into the CircleCI job for testing

You can use the [`--load` flag](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) to download the built container image into the workflow.

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    resource_class: medium
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build and push to Docker Hub with Depot
          command: |
            depot build --load .
workflows:
  run_build:
    jobs:
      - build
```

### Build, push, and load the image back in one command

You can simultaneously push the built image to a registry and load it back into the CI job by using the [`--load` and `--push`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) flag together.

```yaml showLineNumbers
version: 2.1

jobs:
  build:
    machine: true
    resource_class: medium
    steps:
      - checkout
      - run:
          name: Install Depot
          command: |
            curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sudo env DEPOT_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local/bin sh
      - run:
          name: Build and push to Docker Hub with Depot
          command: |
            echo "$DOCKERHUB_PASS" | docker login -u "$DOCKERHUB_USERNAME" --password-stdin
            depot build -t <your-docker-hub-repository> --push --load .
workflows:
  run_build:
    jobs:
      - build
```
