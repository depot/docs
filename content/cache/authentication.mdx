Depot Cache supports authenticating with **user** tokens and **organization** tokens. Additionally, [Depot-managed GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview) are pre-configured with single-use job tokens.

Project tokens are **not** supported for Depot cache.

## Token types

- **User tokens** are used to authenticate as a specific user and can be generated from your [user settings](/settings) page.

- **Organization tokens** are used to authenticate as an organization. These tokens can be generated from your organization's settings page.

- **Depot GitHub Actions runners** are pre-configured with single-use job tokens. If you are using the automatic Depot Cache integration with Depot runners, you do not need to manually configure authentication.

## Configuring build tools
