[**sccache**](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache) is a ccache-like compiler caching tool that was created by Mozilla. It is a compiler wrapper that avoids compilation when possible and stores cached results locally or in remote storage. It supports caching the compilation of several languages including C, C++, and Rust. sccache is used in many large projects, including Firefox, and is optimized for incremental builds and advanced local and remote caching.

[**Depot Cache**](/docs/cache/overview) provides a remote cache service that can be used with sccache, allowing you to incrementally cache and reuse parts of your builds. This cache is accessible from anywhere, both on your local machine and on CI/CD systems.

## Configuring sccache to use Depot Cache

Depot Cache can be used with sccache from Depot's managed GitHub Actions runners, from your local machine, or from any CI/CD system.

### From Depot-managed Actions runners

[Depot GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview) are pre-configured to use Depot Cache with sccache - each runner is launched with a `SCCACHE_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT` environment variable and is pre-configured with the connection details for Depot Cache.

If this automatic configuration is incompatible with your specific setup, you can disable automatic configuration in your organization settings page and manually configure sccache to use Depot Cache as described below.

### From your local machine or any CI/CD system

To manually configure sccache to use Depot Cache, you will need to set two environment variables in your environment, representing the Depot Cache service endpoint and your API token:

```shell
export SCCACHE_WEBDAV_ENDPOINT=https://cache.depot.dev
export SCCACHE_WEBDAV_PASSWORD=DEPOT_TOKEN
```

If you are a member of multiple organizations, and you are authenticating with a user token, you must additionally specify which organization to use for cache storage as follows:

```shell
export SCCACHE_WEBDAV_USERNAME=DEPOT_ORG_ID
```

## Using Depot Cache with sccache

Once sccache is configured to use Depot Cache, you can then run your builds as you normally would. sccache will automatically communicate with Depot Cache to fetch and reuse any stored build artifacts from your previous builds.
