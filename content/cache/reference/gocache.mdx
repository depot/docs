## Configuring Go to use Depot Cache

Depot Cache can be used with Go from Depot's managed GitHub Actions runners, from your local machine, or from any CI/CD system.

### From Depot-managed Actions runners

[Depot GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview) are pre-configured to use Depot Cache with Go - each runner is launched with the `GOCACHEPROG` environment variable pre-populated with the connection details for Depot Cache.

If this automatic configuration is incompatible with your specific setup, you can disable automatic configuration in your organization settings page and manually configure `GOCACHEPROG` to use Depot Cache as described below.

### From your local machine or any CI/CD system

To manually configure Go to use Depot Cache, set the `GOCACHEPROG` in your environment:

```shell
export GOCACHEPROG="depot gocache"
```

The `depot` CLI will need to have [authorization](/docs/cli/authentication) to write to the cache.

If you are a member of multiple organizations, and you are authenticating with a user token, you must instead specify which organization should be used for cache storage as follows:

```shell
export GOCACHEPROG='depot gocache --organization ORG_ID'
```

To clean the cache, you can use the typical `go clean` workflow:

```shell
go clean -cache
```

To set verbose output, add the --verbose option:

```shell
export GOCACHEPROG='depot gocache --verbose'
```

## Using Depot Cache with Go

Once Go is configured to use Depot Cache, you can then run your builds as you normally would. Go will automatically communicate with `GOCACHEPROG` to fetch from Depot Cache and reuse any stored build artifacts from your previous builds.
