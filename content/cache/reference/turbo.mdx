[**Turborepo**](https://turbo.build/) is a high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases, and is designed around scaling build performance for large monorepos. It is used by large projects at Netflix, AWS, and Disney, and supports incremental builds backed by local and remote cache options.

[**Depot Cache**](/docs/cache/overview) provides a remote cache service that can be used with Turborepo, allowing you to incrementally cache and reuse parts of your builds. This cache is accessible from anywhere, both on your local machine and on CI/CD systems.

## Configuring Turborepo to use Depot Cache

Depot Cache can be used with Turborepo from Depot's managed GitHub Actions runners, from your local machine, or from any CI/CD system.

### From Depot-managed Actions runners

[Depot GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview) are pre-configured to use Depot Cache with Turborepo - each runner is launched with a `TURBO_API` environment variable and is pre-configured with the connection details for Depot Cache.

If this automatic configuration is incompatible with your specific setup, you can disable automatic configuration in your organization settings page and manually configure Turborepo to use Depot Cache as described below.

### From your local machine or any CI/CD system

To manually configure Turborepo to use Depot Cache, you will need to set three environment variables in your environment. These represent the Depot Cache service endpoint, your API token, and your Depot organization id:

```shell
export TURBO_API=https://cache.depot.dev
export TURBO_TOKEN=DEPOT_TOKEN
export TURBO_TEAM=DEPOT_ORG_ID
```

## Using Depot Cache with Turborepo

Once Turborepo is configured to use Depot Cache, you can then run your builds as you normally would. Turborepo will automatically communicate with Depot Cache to fetch and reuse any stored build artifacts from your previous builds.

### Using Depot Cache with Turborepo in container builds

Container builds with `depot/build-push-action` don't automatically connect to Depot Cache. Unlike Depot GitHub Actions runners, container builds run on separate VMs and require manual configuration.

You need to pass Turborepo credentials as build secrets (not build arguments) to your container build for the following reasons:

- Build secrets avoid cache invalidation because the values of `TURBO_API` and `TURBO_TOKEN` change.
- Build secrets keep tokens secure and prevent them from persisting in the final image.

Follow these steps to add your Turborepo credentials as build secrets.

1. Create GitHub Secrets for your Turborepo cache variables:
   - `TURBO_API`
   - `TURBO_TOKEN`
   - `TURBO_TEAM`

2. Configure your GitHub Action to pass secrets to the container build:

```yaml
- name: Build and push
  uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    context: .
    file: ./Dockerfile
    push: true
    tags: your-image:tag
    secrets: |
      "TURBO_API=${{ secrets.TURBO_API }}"
      "TURBO_TOKEN=${{ secrets.TURBO_TOKEN }}"
      "TURBO_TEAM=${{ secrets.TURBO_TEAM }}"
```

3. Update your Dockerfile to mount the secrets as environment variables:

```dockerfile
syntax=docker/dockerfile:1
# ^ Required to use secret mounts with environment variables

# ... other Dockerfile instructions

# Mount secrets with IDs matching the environment variable names
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=TURBO_API,env=TURBO_API \
    --mount=type=secret,id=TURBO_TOKEN,env=TURBO_TOKEN \
    --mount=type=secret,id=TURBO_TEAM,env=TURBO_TEAM \
    turbo build
```
