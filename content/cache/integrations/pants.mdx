[**Pants**](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) is an ergonomic build tool for codebases of all sizes and supports Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker. Many large projects use it, including Coinbase, IBM, and Slack, and optimizes for fine-grained incremental builds with advanced local and remote caching. Pants is highly configurable and can scale to codebases of any size.

[**Depot Cache**](/docs/cache/overview) provides a remote cache service that works with Pants, allowing you to incrementally cache and reuse parts of your builds. This cache is accessible from anywhere, both on your local machine and on CI/CD systems.

**Note:** You need a [Depot API token](/docs/cli/authentication) to authenticate with the cache service.

## Local workstation

Enable remote caching in your `pants.toml` file. Replace `DEPOT_TOKEN` with your API token:

```toml
[GLOBAL]
# Enable remote caching
remote_cache_read = true
remote_cache_write = true

# Point remote caching to Depot Cache
remote_store_headers = { "Authorization" = "DEPOT_TOKEN" }
remote_store_address = "grpcs://cache.depot.dev"
```

If you are a member of multiple organizations and authenticating with a user token, additionally specify which organization to use for cache storage using the `x-depot-org` header:

```toml
remote_store_headers = { "x-depot-org" = "DEPOT_ORG_ID" }
```

After you configure Pants to use Depot Cache, run your builds as you normally would. Pants automatically communicates with Depot Cache to fetch and reuse any stored build artifacts from your previous builds.

## Local workstation with containerized builds

When building Docker images that contain Pants projects locally, your build needs access to Pants' remote cache credentials to benefit from caching. Containerized builds execute in isolated environments that require explicit configuration.

### Pants configuration

Update your `pants.toml` to read the Depot token from an environment variable:

```toml
[GLOBAL]
remote_cache_read = true
remote_cache_write = true
remote_store_address = "grpcs://cache.depot.dev"

[GLOBAL.remote_store_headers]
Authorization = "%(env.DEPOT_TOKEN)s"
```

### Dockerfile configuration

Update your Dockerfile to copy the configuration and mount the secret:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ... other Dockerfile instructions

# Copy pants.toml and run build with mounted secret
COPY pants.toml .
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=DEPOT_TOKEN,env=DEPOT_TOKEN \
    pants package ::
```

Adding `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` as the first line of your Dockerfile enables mounting secrets as environment variables.

### Depot CLI

```shell
depot build --secret id=DEPOT_TOKEN,env=DEPOT_TOKEN -t your-image:tag .
```

### Docker buildx

```shell
docker buildx build --secret id=DEPOT_TOKEN,env=DEPOT_TOKEN -t your-image:tag .
```

### Bake

Define the secret in your `docker-bake.hcl` file:

```hcl
target "default" {
  context    = "."
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  tags       = ["your-image:tag"]
  secret = [
    {
      type = "env"
      id   = "DEPOT_TOKEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then run the build:

```shell
DEPOT_TOKEN=your_token depot bake
```

## Depot GitHub Actions runners

[Depot GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview) are pre-configured to use Depot Cache with Pants. Each runner launches with a `pants.toml` file pre-configured with the connection details for Depot Cache.

You don't need additional configuration. Run your Pants builds as normal:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - run: pants package ::
```

To disable automatic configuration, turn off **Allow Actions jobs to automatically connect to Depot Cache** in your organization settings page. You can then manually configure Pants as described in the Local workstation section.

## Depot GitHub Actions runners with containerized builds

When running containerized builds on Depot GitHub Actions runners, your build needs access to Pants' remote cache credentials. These credentials aren't automatically available inside your Docker build environment.

### Pants configuration

Update your `pants.toml` to read the Depot token from an environment variable:

```toml
[GLOBAL]
remote_cache_read = true
remote_cache_write = true
remote_store_address = "grpcs://cache.depot.dev"

[GLOBAL.remote_store_headers]
Authorization = "%(env.DEPOT_TOKEN)s"
```

### Dockerfile configuration

Update your Dockerfile to mount the secret and run the build:

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

# ... other Dockerfile instructions

# Copy pants.toml and run build with mounted secret
COPY pants.toml .
RUN --mount=type=secret,id=DEPOT_TOKEN,env=DEPOT_TOKEN \
    pants package ::
```

Adding `# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1` as the first line of your Dockerfile enables mounting secrets as environment variables.

### `depot/build-push-action`

Store the Depot token in a GitHub Secret named `DEPOT_TOKEN`, then configure your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build and push
  uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    context: .
    file: ./Dockerfile
    push: true
    tags: your-image:tag
    secrets: |
      "DEPOT_TOKEN=${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}"
```

### `depot/bake-action`

Define the secret in your `docker-bake.hcl` file:

```hcl
target "default" {
  context    = "."
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  tags       = ["your-image:tag"]
  secret = [
    {
      type = "env"
      id   = "DEPOT_TOKEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then configure your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Bake
  uses: depot/bake-action@v1
  with:
    files: docker-bake.hcl
  env:
    DEPOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
```

### Docker CLI

Store the Depot token in a GitHub Secret named `DEPOT_TOKEN`, then configure your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Build
  run: |
    docker buildx build \
      --secret id=DEPOT_TOKEN,env=DEPOT_TOKEN \
      -t your-image:tag .
  env:
    DEPOT_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.DEPOT_TOKEN }}
```
