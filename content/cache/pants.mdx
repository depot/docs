[**Pants**](https://www.pantsbuild.org/) is an ergonomic build tool for codebases of all sizes and supports Python, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Shell, and Docker. It is used in many large projects, including Coinbase, IBM, and Slack, and is optimized for fine-grained incremental builds with advanced local and remote cachin. Pants is highly configurable and can scale to codebases of any size.

[**Depot Cache**](/docs/cache/overview) provides a remote cache service that can be used with Pants, allowing you to incrementally cache and reuse parts of your builds. This cache is accessible from anywhere, both on your local machine and on CI/CD systems.

## Configuring Pants to use Depot Cache

Depot Cache can be used with Pants from Depot's managed GitHub Actions runners, from your local machine, or from any CI/CD system.

### From Depot-managed Actions runners

[Depot GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview) are pre-configured to use Depot Cache with Pants - each runner is launched with a `pants.toml` file that is pre-configured with the connection details for Depot Cache.

If this automatic configuration is incompatible with your specific setup, you can disable automatic configuration in your organization settings page and manually configure Pants to use Depot Cache as described below.

### From your local machine or any CI/CD system

To manually configure Pants to use Depot Cache, you will need to enable remote caching in your `pants.toml`. Configure Pants to use the Depot Cache service endpoints and set your API token in the `Authorization` header:

`pants.toml`:

```toml
[GLOBAL]
# Enable remote caching
remote_cache_read = true
remote_cache_write = true

# Point remote caching to Depot Cache
remote_store_headers = { "Authorization" = "DEPOT_TOKEN" }
remote_store_address = "grpcs://cache.depot.dev"
```

If you are a member of multiple organizations, and you are authenticating with a user token, you must additionally specify which organization to use for cache storage using the `x-depot-org` header:

```toml
remote_store_headers = { "x-depot-org" = "DEPOT_ORG_ID" }
```

## Using Depot Cache with Pants

Once Pants is configured to use Depot Cache, you can then run your builds as you normally would. Pants will automatically communicate with Depot Cache to fetch and reuse any stored build artifacts from your previous builds.
