The Depot API is a collection of gRPC endpoints that grant access to our underlying architecture that make Docker image builds fast and reliable. It allows organizations to manage projects, acquire BuildKit endpoints, and run image builds their applications or services using our build architecture.

We currently support the following SDKs for interacting with Depot:

- [Node](https://github.com/depot/sdk-node)

## Authentication

Authentication to the API is handled via an `Authorization` header with the value being an Organization Token that you generate inside of your Organization Settings. See the [Authentication docs](/docs/api/authentication) for more details.

## Security

If you're going to be using the Depot Build API to build untrusted code, you need **one Depot project per customer entity in your system**. This is to ensure secure cache isolation between your customers so that one customer's build can't access another customer's build cache.

## API Reference

### Project Service

Docs: [`depot.core.v1.ProjectService`](https://buf.build/depot/api/docs/main:depot.core.v1#depot.core.v1.ProjectService)

A project is an isolated cache. Projects belong to a single organization and are never shared. They represent the layer cache associated with the images built inside of it; you can build multiple images for different platforms with a single project. Or you can choose to have one project per image built.

When you want to segregate your customer builds from one another, we recommend one project per customer.

#### List projects for an organization

You can list all of the projects for your org with an empty request payload.

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const result = await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.listProjects({}, {headers})

console.log(result.projects)
```

#### Create a project

To create a project, you need to pass a request that contains the name of the project, the id of your organization, the region you want to create the project in, and the cache volume size you want to use with the project.

Supported regions:

- `us-east-1`
- `eu-central-1`

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const result = await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.createProject(
  {
    name: 'my-project',
    organizationId: 'org-id',
    regionId: 'us-east-1',
    cachePolicy: {keepBytes: 50 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, keepDays: 14},
  },
  {headers},
)

console.log(result.project)
```

#### Get a project

To get a project, you need to pass the ID of the project you want to get.

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const result = await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.getProject({projectId: 'project-id'}, {headers})

console.log(result.project)
```

#### Update a project

To update a project, you can pass the ID of the project you want to update and the fields you want to update.

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const result = await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.updateProject(
  {
    projectId: 'project-id',
    name: 'my-project',
    regionId: 'us-east-1',
    cachePolicy: {keepBytes: 50 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024, keepDays: 14},
  },
  {headers},
)

console.log(result.project)
```

#### Delete a project

You can delete a project by ID. This will destroy any underlying volumes associated with the project.

```typescript
await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.deleteProject({projectId: 'project-id'}, {headers})
```

#### List trust policies for a project

```typescript
const policies = await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.listTrustPolicies({projectId: 'project-id'}, {headers})
```

#### Add a trust policy for a project

```typescript
// GitHub
await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.addTrustPolicy(
  {
    projectId: 'project-id',
    provider: {
      case: 'github',
      value: {
        repositoryOwner: 'org',
        repository: 'repo',
      },
    },
  },
  {headers},
)
```

```typescript
// BuildKite
await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.addTrustPolicy(
  {
    projectId: 'project-id',
    provider: {
      case: 'buildkite',
      value: {
        organizationSlug: 'org',
        pipelineSlug: 'pipeline',
      },
    },
  },
  {headers},
)
```

```typescript
// GitHub
await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.addTrustPolicy(
  {
    projectId: 'project-id',
    provider: {
      case: 'circleci',
      value: {
        organizationUuid: 'uuid',
        projectUuid: 'uuid',
      },
    },
  },
  {headers},
)
```

#### Remove a trust policy for a project

```typescript
await depot.core.v1.ProjectService.removeTrustPolicy({projectId: 'project-id', trustPolicyId: 'policy-id'}, {headers})
```

### Build Service

Docs: [`depot.build.v1.BuildService`](https://buf.build/depot/api/docs/main:depot.build.v1#depot.build.v1.BuildService)

A build is a single image build within a given project. Once you create a build for a project, you get back an ID to reference it and a token for authentication.

#### Create a build

To create a build, you need to pass a request that contains the ID of the project you want to build in.

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const result = await depot.build.v1.BuildService.createBuild({projectId: 'project-id'}, {headers})

console.log(result.buildId)
console.log(result.buildToken)
```

##### Using the build id & token

If you're not managing the build context yourself in code via `buildx`, you can use the Depot CLI to build a given `Dockerfile` as we wrap `buildx` inside our CLI. With a build created via our API, you pass along the project, build ID, and token as environment variables:

```bash
DEPOT_BUILD_ID=<build-id>
DEPOT_TOKEN=<build-token>
DEPOT_PROJECT_ID=<project-id>
depot build -f Dockerfile
```

#### Finish a build

**Note: You only need to do this if you're managing the build context yourself in code via `buildx`.**

To mark a build as finished and clean up the underlying BuildKit endpoint, you need to pass the ID of the build you want to finish and the error result if there was one.

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}
await depot.build.v1.BuildService.finishBuild({buildId: 'build-id', result: {error: 'error message'}}, {headers})
```

### BuildKit Service

Docs: [`depot.buildkit.v1.BuildKitService`](https://buf.build/depot/api/docs/main:depot.buildkit.v1#depot.buildkit.v1.BuildKitService)

The BuildKit service provides lower level access to the underlying BuildKit endpoints that power the image builds. They give you the ability to interact with the underlying builders without needing the Depot CLI as a dependency. For example, you can use the [`buildx` Go library](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/docker/buildx) with the given BuildKit endpoint to build images from your own code via Depot.

#### Get a BuildKit endpoint

To get a BuildKit endpoint, you need to pass the ID of the build you want to get the endpoint for and the platform you want to build.

Supported platforms:

- `PLATFORM_AMD64` for `linux/amd64` builds
- `PLATFORM_ARM64` for `linux/arm64` builds

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const createBuildResult = await depot.build.v1.BuildService.createBuild({projectId: 'project-id'}, {headers})

const getEndpointResult = await depot.buildkit.v1.BuildKitService.getEndpoint(
  {buildId: 'build-id', platform: 'PLATFORM_AMD64'},
  {Authorization: `Bearer ${createBuildResult.build_token}`},
)

console.log(getEndpointResult.connection)
```

When a connection is active and ready to be used the `connection` property will be populated with the following fields:

- `endpoint`: The BuildKit endpoint to connect to
- `server_name`: The server name to use for TLS verification
- `certificate`: The certificate to use for TLS verification to the endpoint
- `ca_cert`: The CA certificate to use for TLS verification to the endpoint

#### Report the health of a build

To report the health of a build, you need to pass the ID of the build you want to report and the platform.

**Once you acquire a BuildKit endpoint, you must report the health of the build to Depot or the underlying resources will be removed after 5 minutes of inactivity.**

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const result = await depot.build.v1.BuildKitService.reportHealth(
  {buildId: 'build-id', platform: 'PLATFORM_AMD64'},
  {headers},
)
```

#### Release the endpoint for a build

To release the endpoint for a build, you need to pass the ID of the build you want to release and the platform.

This endpoint tells Depot you're are done using that endpoint and we can schedule it for removal.

```typescript
const headers = {Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.DEPOT_TOKEN}`}

const result = await depot.build.v1.BuildKitService.releaseEndpoint(
  {buildId: 'build-id', platform: 'PLATFORM_AMD64'},
  {Authorization: `Bearer ${createBuildResult.build_token}`},
)
```
