The Depot API is a collection of endpoints that grant access to the underlying architecture. Organizations can manage projects, acquire BuildKit endpoints, and run image builds for their applications or services programmatically.

The API uses Connect, offering [multiprotocol support](https://connectrpc.com/docs/introduction#seamless-multi-protocol-support) for gRPC and HTTP JSON. Depot provides the following SDKs for interacting with the API:

- [Node](https://github.com/depot/sdk-node)
- [Go](https://github.com/depot/depot-go)

For detailed documentation on all available endpoints, parameters, and examples, see the [SDK Reference](/docs/api/sdk-reference).

## Authentication

Authenticate to the API using an `Authorization` header with an Organization Token that you generate in your [organization settings](/orgs/_/settings). See the [Authentication docs](/docs/api/authentication) for more details.

## Security

If you're using the Depot API to build untrusted code, you need **one Depot project per customer entity in your organization**. A separate project per customer ensures secure cache isolation so that one customer's build can't access another customer's build cache.
