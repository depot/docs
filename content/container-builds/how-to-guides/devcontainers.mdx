## Why use Depot with Dev Containers?

[Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) are becoming a popular way to leverage a container as a fully featured development environment directly integrated with Visual Studio Code. You can open any folder inside a container and use the full power of VS Code inside.

With Depot, you can build your Dev Containers on demand with instant shared caching across your entire team.

## How to use Depot with Dev Containers

First, you will need to make sure you have [installed the `depot` CLI](/docs/container-builds/quickstart#installing-the-cli) and [configured a project](/docs/container-builds/quickstart#creating-a-project).

### Connect to your Depot project from the `depot` CLI

Once the CLI is installed, you can configure your environment:

1. Run `depot login` to login to your Depot account
2. Change into the root of your project directory
3. Run `depot init` to link your project to your repository; this will create a `depot.json` directory in the current directory

**Note: You can also connect `depot` to your project by passing the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable**

### Configure Docker to use Depot

Dev Containers uses the `docker buildx build` command internally to build the container image. You can configure Depot as a plugin for the Docker CLI and Buildx with the following command:

```bash
depot configure-docker
```

The `configure-docker` command is a one-time operation that routes any `docker build` or `docker buildx build` commands to Depot builders.

### Build your Dev Container

There are multiple options for building your Dev Container:

1. You can open an existing folder in VS Code in a container, [see these docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)
2. You can open a Git repo or Pull Request in an isolated container, [see these docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers#_quick-start-open-a-git-repository-or-github-pr-in-an-isolated-container-volume)
3. You can also build your Dev container directly using the [`devcontainer` CLI](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/devcontainer-cli#_prebuilding):

```bash
devcontainer build --workspace-folder .

```

You should see something similar to the above in your VS Code or `devcontainer` build logs. You can see that the `docker buildx build` command is called, and then you see log lines for `[depot] ...` that confirm your Docker image build is routed to Depot builders.
