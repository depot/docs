## Why use Depot with your CI provider?

Depot provides a remote Docker build service that makes the image build process faster and more intelligent.

By routing the image build step of your CI to Depot, you can complete the image build up to 40x faster than you could in your generic CI provider. Saving you build minutes in your existing CI provider and, more importantly, saving you developer time waiting for the build to finish.

The `depot build` command is a drop-in replacement for `docker build` and `docker buildx build`. Alternatively, you can [configure your local Docker CLI to use Depot as the default builder](/docs/container-builds/how-to-guides/docker-build). Depot launches remote builders for both native Intel & Arm CPUs with, by default, 16 CPUs, 32 GB of memory, and a 50 GB persistent NVMe cache SSD. On a startup or business plan, in your project settings, you can configure your builders to be larger, with up to 64 CPUs and 128 GB of memory.

Running `depot` in a continuous integration environment is a great way to get fast and consistent builds with any CI provider. See below for documentation on integrating Depot with your CI provider.
