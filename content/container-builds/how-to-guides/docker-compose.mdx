description: Use Depot with Docker Compose, to accelerate the builds of all Compose services.

Depot can be used with Docker Compose to efficiently build images for all the services in your `docker-compose.yml` file using Depot's accelerated container build infrastructure.

There are two ways to use Depot with Docker Compose:

1. Using `depot bake --load` with a `docker-compose.yml` file to build all images in parallel and load them back into your local Docker daemon.
2. Using `docker compose build` with `depot configure-docker` to use Depot as a Docker Buildx driver inside Docker Compose.

## Building images with `depot bake --load`

The `depot bake` command is a powerful and efficient way to build multiple container images in parallel with a single command. The command implements the features of [docker buildx bake](https://docs.docker.com/build/bake/), but optimized to work with Depot infrastructure.

With `depot bake` you can provide a `docker-compose.yml` file, and Depot will build all service images specified in the compose file in parallel. Additionally by specifying the `--load` flag, those images will be efficiently pulled back into your local Docker daemon:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

```shell
# Will build both the app and backend images in parallel
$ depot bake -f ./docker-compose.yml --load
```

Once the images are loaded into your local Docker daemon, they are ready to be used by Docker Compose. For instance, you could run `docker compose up` and Compose would use the images just built by Depot.

**This is the preferred way to build images with Depot for Docker Compose.** The `depot bake` command is optimized to work with Depot infrastructure and is able to efficiently load images back into your local Docker daemon. However if you need to use `docker compose build` specifically and cannot call `depot bake`, see below for information on how to integrate Depot as a Docker Buildx driver.

See the [bake deep dive](https://depot.dev/blog/buildx-bake-deep-dive) for more information about `depot bake`.

### Using multiple Depot projects with `depot bake`

As a more advanced use-case, it's possible to use different Depot projects to build the different services in a Compose file. To specify different projects, you can use the `x-depot.project-id` extension value in the Compose service build configuration:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  app:
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      x-depot:
        project-id: abc123456

  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
      x-depot:
        project-id: xyz123456
```

With the above configuration, the `app` service will be built in the `abc123456` Depot project and the `backend` service will be built in the `xyz123456` Depot project when running `depot bake`.

## Building images with `docker compose build`

If you are unable to use `depot bake --load` and need to use `docker compose build` directly, you can still use Depot to accelerate your builds. Docker Compose can use Docker Buildx to build the requested images in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and Depot can be installed as a Buildx driver serve those build requests.

To do so, first run `depot configure-docker`. This configures Depot as the default handler for `docker build` and `docker buildx build`:

```shell
$ depot configure-docker
```

Once configured, you can use `docker compose build` as usual. The `build` command will use the Depot Buildx driver to build the images specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file:

```shell
$ docker compose build
```

See the [Docker integration guide](/docs/container-builds/how-to-guides/docker-build) for more information about `depot configure-docker`.

### Caveats

When using `docker compose build` with Depot, there are a few things to be aware of:

1. Buildx requires that the entire image be converted into a tarball and downloaded from the remote build server to the local Docker daemon before it can be used. This is less efficient than using `depot bake --load`, which is able to efficiently pull only the missing layers of an image back into the local Docker daemon.

2. Buildx will create a new Depot build request for each service image, so the Depot console will not display the `docker compose build` as a single unified request.

3. It's not possible to use multiple different Depot projects for different Compose services with `docker compose build`.

However, `depot configure-docker` does directly integrate with any tools that use Docker Buildx, so if you are unable to use `depot bake --load` or otherwise need full Buildx compatibility with other tools, this is a good option.

## Building and testing `docker compose` on GitHub Actions

With the `depot/bake-action` action and the `--save` flag, we can build all of the services in a Compose file in parallel and save them to the Depot Registry. Then, with the `depot/pull-action`, we can pull all of the images back into the local Docker daemon for testing in subsequent jobs.

```yaml
name: Depot example compose
on: push

permissions:
  contents: read
  id-token: write
  packages: write

jobs:
  build-services:
    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
    outputs:
      build-id: ${{ steps.bake.outputs.build-id }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: depot/setup-action@v1
      - name: Build, cache, and save all compose images to the Depot Registry.
        uses: depot/bake-action@v1
        id: bake
        with:
          files: docker-compose.yml
          save: true

  test:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-22.04
    needs: [build-services]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: depot/setup-action@v1
      - name: Pull all compose service images locally from the Depot Registry.
        uses: depot/pull-action@v1
        with:
          build-id: ${{ needs.build-services.outputs.build-id }}
      - name: Run compose up (images should not rebuild)
        run: |
          docker compose up -d
      - name: If successful, push the srv1 compose service target image to ghcr.io from Depot Registry
        run: |
          echo ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} | docker login ghcr.io -u $ --password-stdin
          depot push --target srv1 -t ghcr.io/depot/srv1:latest ${{ steps.build.outputs.build-id }}
```
