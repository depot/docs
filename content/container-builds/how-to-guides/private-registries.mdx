The Depot CLI uses your local Docker credentials provider. To allow your Depot build to access a private image registry, log into the registry with `docker login registry.example.com` on the same machine where you'll run `depot build`. Use the private registry in your Dockerfile as you normally would:

```dockerfile
FROM my-private-registry/project/image:version
# rest of your Dockerfile
```

Then run `depot build .`.

You should be able to use any registry with no additional Depot configuration. If you're having issues accessing private registries from your builds, see [Cannot pull from private registry during build](/docs/container-builds/troubleshooting#cannot-pull-from-private-registry-during-build).
