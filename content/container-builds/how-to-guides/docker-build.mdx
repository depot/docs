## Running builds with Depot

To run builds with Depot via `docker`, you still need to connect the build to an active Depot project via the `depot init` and `depot.json` files or via the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

## How to use Depot with Docker

Depot can directly integrate with your existing Docker workflows via a one-time configuration command from our `depot` CLI. See [our instructions for installing our CLI](/docs/cli/installation) if you still need to do so.

With the CLI installed, you can run `configure-docker` to configure your Docker CLI to use Depot as the default handler for `docker build` and `docker buildx build`:

```shell
depot configure-docker
```

Underneath the hood, the `configure-docker` command installs Depot as a Docker CLI plugin and sets the plugin as the default Docker builder (i.e., `docker build`). In addition, the command also installs a Depot `buildx` driver and sets that driver as the default driver for `docker buildx build`.

### `docker build`

Once your `docker` environment is configured to use Depot, you can run your builds as usual.

```shell
docker build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .
```

If you have correctly configured your Depot project via `depot init` or `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID`, your build will automatically be sent to Depot for execution. You can confirm this by looking for log lines in the output that are prefixed with `[depot]`.

### `docker buildx build`

Similarly, once your environment is configured to use Depot, you can run your `docker buildx build` commands as usual.

```shell
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64 .
```

Again, you can confirm that builds are going to your Depot project by looking for log lines that are prefixed with `[depot]` or by checking out the [builds for your project](/orgs).

## Using Depot with Docker Compose

You can efficiently build Compose service images in parallel with Depot, with either `depot bake --load -f ./docker-compose.yml` or `docker compose build`. See [the Docker Compose integration guide](/docs/container-builds/how-to-guides/docker-compose) for more information.
