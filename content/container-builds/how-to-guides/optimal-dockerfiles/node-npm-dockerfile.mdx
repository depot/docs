Below is an example `Dockerfile` that we recommend at Depot for building images for Node.js applications with npm.

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM node:lts AS build

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --only=production --no-audit --no-fund

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --no-audit --no-fund

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

FROM node:lts AS runtime

RUN groupadd -g 1001 appgroup && \
    useradd -u 1001 -g appgroup -m -d /app -s /bin/false appuser

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build --chown=appuser:appgroup /app .

ENV NODE_ENV=production \
    NODE_OPTIONS="--enable-source-maps"

USER appuser

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Explanation of the Dockerfile

At a high level, here are the things we're optimizing in our Docker build for a Node.js application:

- Multi-stage builds via multiple `FROM` statements
- npm cache mounts for dependency caching
- Security optimizations with non-root users

### Stage 1: `FROM node:lts AS build`

```dockerfile
FROM node:lts AS build

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --only=production --no-audit --no-fund
```

We start with the Node.js LTS image as our build stage base. We copy only the package files first to leverage Docker's layer caching. The `npm ci` command is used for faster, reliable, reproducible builds with a cache mount to persist downloaded packages. We first install production dependencies only.

#### Installing all dependencies

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
```

We then install all dependencies (including dev dependencies) needed for building the application, using the same cache mount for efficiency.

#### Building the application

```dockerfile
COPY . .

RUN npm run build
```

After copying the source code, we build the application. This step is separate from dependency installation to maximize cache efficiency.

### Stage 2: `FROM node:lts AS runtime`

```dockerfile
FROM node:lts AS runtime

RUN groupadd -g 1001 appgroup && \
    useradd -u 1001 -g appgroup -m -d /app -s /bin/false appuser

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=build --chown=appuser:appgroup /app .

ENV NODE_ENV=production \
    NODE_OPTIONS="--enable-source-maps"

USER appuser

ENTRYPOINT ["node", "server.js"]
```

The runtime stage uses the Node.js LTS image and creates a non-root user for security. We copy the entire built application from the build stage, setting appropriate ownership.

## Understanding BuildKit Cache Mounts

Cache mounts are one of the most powerful features for optimizing Docker builds with Depot. This Dockerfile uses the following cache mount syntax:

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.npm \
    npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
```

### Cache Mount Parameters Explained

- **`type=cache`**: Specifies this is a cache mount. The cache persists across builds and is managed by BuildKit (and Depot's distributed cache system).
- **`target=/root/.npm`**: The mount point inside the container where npm's default cache is located. This uses npm's standard cache directory without requiring additional configuration.

For more information regarding npm cache mounts, please visit the official [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npm-cache).
