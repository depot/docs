description: A sample optimal Dockerfile for building images for .NET Worker Service applications from us at Depot.

Below is an example `Dockerfile` that we recommend at Depot for building images for .NET Worker Service applications.

```dockerfile
# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build

WORKDIR /src

COPY src/WorkerService/WorkerService.csproj src/WorkerService/
COPY *.sln ./

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/v3-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/plugins-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/tmp/NuGetScratchroot \
    dotnet restore

COPY src/ src/

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/v3-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/plugins-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/tmp/NuGetScratchroot \
    dotnet publish "src/WorkerService/WorkerService.csproj" \
    --no-restore \
    --configuration Release \
    --self-contained true \
    --output /app/publish \
    /p:PublishSingleFile=true

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:8.0 AS runtime

WORKDIR /app

RUN groupadd -g 1001 appgroup \
    && useradd -u 1001 -g appgroup -m -d /app -s /bin/false appuser

COPY --from=build --chown=appuser:appgroup /app/publish/WorkerService .

USER appuser

ENV DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true \
    DOTNET_EnableDiagnostics=0

ENTRYPOINT ["./WorkerService"]
```

## Explanation of the Dockerfile

At a high level, here are the things we're optimizing in our Docker build for a .NET Worker Service:

- Self-contained deployment for standalone executables
- Minimal runtime dependencies
- Single-file publishing for simplified deployment
- Security optimizations with non-root users

### Stage 1: `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build`

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build

WORKDIR /src

COPY src/WorkerService/WorkerService.csproj src/WorkerService/
COPY *.sln ./
```

We use the .NET 8 SDK image and set up the build environment for building the Worker Service application.

#### Dependency restoration

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/v3-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/plugins-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/tmp/NuGetScratchroot \
    dotnet restore
```

We restore NuGet packages with cache mounts to persist dependencies between builds, improving build performance on subsequent runs.

#### Self-contained publishing

```dockerfile
COPY src/ src/

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/v3-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/plugins-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/tmp/NuGetScratchroot \
    dotnet publish "src/WorkerService/WorkerService.csproj" \
    --no-restore \
    --configuration Release \
    --self-contained true \
    --output /app/publish \
    /p:PublishSingleFile=true
```

The publish command includes several important options:

- `--no-restore` skips package restoration since we already restored dependencies
- `--self-contained true` includes the .NET runtime in the output
- `/p:PublishSingleFile=true` creates a single executable file
- `--configuration Release` builds in release mode for production

### Stage 2: `FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:8.0 AS runtime`

```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/runtime-deps:8.0 AS runtime

WORKDIR /app

RUN groupadd -g 1001 appgroup \
    && useradd -u 1001 -g appgroup -m -d /app -s /bin/false appuser
```

The runtime stage uses the `runtime-deps` image, which contains only the native dependencies needed by self-contained .NET applications. We create a non-root user for security.

#### Runtime configuration

```dockerfile
COPY --from=build --chown=appuser:appgroup /app/publish/WorkerService .

USER appuser

ENV DOTNET_RUNNING_IN_CONTAINER=true \
    DOTNET_EnableDiagnostics=0

ENTRYPOINT ["./WorkerService"]
```

We copy only the single executable file from the build stage, switch to a non-root user, and configure the .NET runtime for container environments.

## Benefits of self-contained deployment

Self-contained deployment offers several advantages for Worker Services:

- **No runtime dependencies**: The image doesn't need the .NET runtime installed
- **Smaller attack surface**: Fewer components in the final image
- **Version consistency**: The exact .NET version is bundled with the application
- **Simplified deployment**: Single executable file is easier to manage

## Runtime dependencies explained

The `runtime-deps` image provides only the native dependencies required by .NET:

- **Minimal base**: Essential system libraries for .NET execution
- **No .NET runtime**: The runtime is included in the self-contained executable

## Understanding BuildKit Cache Mounts

Cache mounts are one of the most powerful features for optimizing Docker builds with Depot. This Dockerfile uses the following cache mount syntax:

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.nuget/packages \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/v3-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.local/share/NuGet/plugins-cache \
    --mount=type=cache,target=/tmp/NuGetScratchroot \
    dotnet restore
```

### Cache Mount Parameters Explained

- **`type=cache`**: Specifies this is a cache mount that persists across builds.

- **Multiple NuGet cache targets**:
  - **`/root/.nuget/packages`**: Global NuGet package cache
  - **`/root/.local/share/NuGet/v3-cache`**: NuGet v3 API metadata cache
  - **`/root/.local/share/NuGet/plugins-cache`**: NuGet plugins cache
  - **`/tmp/NuGetScratchroot`**: Temporary extraction directory
