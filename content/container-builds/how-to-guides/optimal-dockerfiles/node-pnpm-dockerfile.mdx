Below is an example `Dockerfile` that we use and recommend at Depot when we are building Docker images for Node applications that use `pnpm` as their package manager.

```dockerfile
FROM node:20 AS base

FROM base AS deps

RUN corepack enable
WORKDIR /app
COPY pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm fetch --frozen-lockfile
COPY package.json ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod

FROM base AS build

RUN corepack enable
WORKDIR /app
COPY pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm fetch --frozen-lockfile
COPY package.json ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build

FROM base

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/dist /app/dist
ENV NODE_ENV production
CMD ["node", "./dist/index.js"]

```

## Explanation of the Dockerfile

There are several things in this example Dockerfile that are worth calling out. Most notably, we use a multi-stage build to separate the installation of dependencies from the actual build of the application. This allows us to take advantage of Docker's layer caching to speed up our builds.

#### Stage 1: `FROM node:20 AS base`

```dockerfile
FROM node:20 AS base
```

Here we use the `node:20` base image and set the stage name to be reused in stages that follow. If we had common dependencies that we wanted to be accessible in any stages using this `base` stage, we could install them here.

#### Stage 2: `FROM base AS deps`

```dockerfile
FROM base AS deps

RUN corepack enable
WORKDIR /app
COPY pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm fetch --frozen-lockfile
COPY package.json ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod
```

Next up is installing our dependencies via `pnpm`.

First, we enable [`corepack`](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html) in the Node `base` image. Corepack allows us to use `pnpm` right out of the box without having to install it ourselves. It's a nice convenience but watch out that you have the expected `pnpm` version.

We then create our working directory, `app`, and copy in just our `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files. Note that we do not copy in our entire codebase. We only care about installing our production dependencies at this stage. This is a best practice that allows us to take advantage of Docker's layer caching.

Finally, we get to installing our packages via `pnpm`. This is broken into two `RUN` statements that are making use of [BuildKit cache mounts](/blog/how-to-use-buildkit-cache-mounts-in-ci).

1. `pnpm fetch --frozen-lockfile` is a [pnpm feature](https://pnpm.io/cli/fetch) that is designed to improve building a Docker image. It fetches packages from the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file and stores them in the `pnpm` virtual store. Ignoring the `package.json` manifest. It's a nice optimization that avoids having to reinstall all packages in the `package.json` when a change occurs there that isn't related to the actual dependencies.

2. `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile --prod` is the actual installation of our dependencies. We use the `--frozen-lockfile` flag to ensure that we are installing the exact same versions of our dependencies that are in our `package.json`. We also use the `--prod` flag to ensure that we are not installing any `devDependencies`.

This is a best practice that allows us to take advantage of Docker's layer caching.

We use the `--frozen-lockfile` flag to ensure that we are installing the exact same versions of our dependencies that we have installed locally. We also use the `--prod` flag to ensure that we are only installing our production dependencies. This is a best practice that allows us to take advantage of Docker's layer caching.

#### Stage 3: `FROM base AS build`

```dockerfile
FROM base AS build

RUN corepack enable
WORKDIR /app
COPY pnpm-lock.yaml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm fetch --frozen-lockfile
COPY package.json ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,id=pnpm,target=/root/.local/share/pnpm/store pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
COPY . .
RUN pnpm build
```

It's time to build our application. We start by enabling `corepack` again so that we have `pnpm` in this stage. We then configure our working directory to be `app` and copy in the `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` files as we saw in the `deps` stage.

We then run `pnpm fetch --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` again. However, we omit the `--prod` flag as we want to install _all dependencies_ as we may need some dev ones to build our final application. If that wasn't the case, we could copy in our dependencies from our earlier `deps` stage.

Once our dependencies have been installed into this stage, we then copy in our source code via the `COPY` statement. We then run our build command, `pnpm build`.

#### Stage 4: `FROM base`

```dockerfile
FROM base

WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=deps /app/node_modules /app/node_modules
COPY --from=build /app/dist /app/dist
ENV NODE_ENV production
CMD ["node", "./dist/index.js"]
```

Our final stage is copying all of the files from our earlier stages into our final image. We start by setting our working directory to `app`, then have several `COPY` statements:

1. We copy in our `node_modules` from our `deps` stage
2. We then copy in the `dist` directory from our `build` stage containing the outputs from our `pnpm build`

Finally, we set our `NODE_ENV` to production for any dependencies that have an optimized production mode. We then set our `CMD` to run our application.
