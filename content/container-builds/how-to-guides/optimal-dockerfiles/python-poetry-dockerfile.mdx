Below is an example `Dockerfile` that we use and recommend at Depot when we are building Docker images for Python applications that use `poetry`as their package manager.

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.12-slim as base
ENV  POETRY_VERSION=1.6.1 \
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
  PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=off \
  PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=on \
  PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=100 \
  POETRY_HOME="/opt/poetry" \
  POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true \
  POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1 \
  PYSETUP_PATH="/opt/pysetup" \
  VENV_PATH="/opt/pysetup/.venv"
ENV PATH="$POETRY_HOME/bin:$VENV_PATH/bin:$PATH"


FROM base as builder
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache \
  pip install "poetry==$POETRY_VERSION"
WORKDIR $PYSETUP_PATH
COPY ./poetry.lock ./pyproject.toml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=$POETRY_HOME/pypoetry/cache \
  poetry install --no-dev


FROM base as production
ENV FASTAPI_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder $VENV_PATH $VENV_PATH
COPY ./app /app
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

## Explanation of the Dockerfile

[Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) is a popular Python package manager that helps manage dependencies on your local machine using virtual environments to isolate dependency versions between projects. In a Docker environment, we don't need to use virtual environments, and we can instead use a more straightforward approach to installing and managing dependencies. Assuming your project is currently using Poetry and has a `pyproject.toml` file, you can use the following Dockerfile to build your project with multi-stage builds to produce an efficient build and optimized final image.

### Stage 1: `FROM python:3.12-slim-bookworm AS base`

Using a common base image for all stages ensures compatibility between the build and deployment stages and allows us to take advantage of Docker's layer caching to produce fewer layers in the build. An `-alpine` image can also be used for an even smaller final image, but some projects may require additional dependencies to be installed.

```dockerfile
ENV  POETRY_VERSION=1.6.1 \
  PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 \
  PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 \
  PIP_NO_CACHE_DIR=off \
  PIP_DISABLE_PIP_VERSION_CHECK=on \
  PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=100 \
  POETRY_HOME="/opt/poetry" \
  POETRY_VIRTUALENVS_IN_PROJECT=true \
  POETRY_NO_INTERACTION=1 \
  PYSETUP_PATH="/opt/pysetup" \
  VENV_PATH="/opt/pysetup/.venv"
ENV PATH="$POETRY_HOME/bin:$VENV_PATH/bin:$PATH"
```

- `POETRY_VERSION=1.6.1` specifies the version of Poetry to install.
- `PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1` tells Python to not buffer the output. This is useful for ensuring logs are output in real-time, so a crash doesn't obscure the logs that would otherwise be in a buffer.
- `POETRY_HOME` specifies a deterministic location for Poetry to install itself.
- `PYSETUP_PATH` specifies a deterministic location for Poetry to install the project's dependencies.
- `VENV_PATH` specifies a deterministic location for the virtual environment to be created.

```dockerfile
ENV PATH="$POETRY_HOME/bin:$VENV_PATH/bin:$PATH"
```

After setting the environment variables, we add the Poetry and virtual environment paths to the `PATH` environment variable so that we can run Poetry and the project's dependencies without specifying the full path.

### Stage 2: `FROM base AS builder`

The builder stage efficiently installs Poetry and the project's production dependencies with caching enabled. A similar stage can be used for development dependencies if needed by changing the `--no-dev` flag in the `poetry install` command.

```dockerfile
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache \
  pip install "poetry==$POETRY_VERSION"
WORKDIR $PYSETUP_PATH
COPY ./poetry.lock ./pyproject.toml ./
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=$POETRY_HOME/pypoetry/cache \
  poetry install --no-dev
```

We use `pip` to install `poetry` so we can cache the installation. Then, we copy over only the `poetry.lock` and `pyproject.toml` files to the `$PYSETUP_PATH` directory and run `poetry install` to install the project's dependencies. By using the `--no-dev` flag, we ensure that only production dependencies are installed.

### Stage 3: `FROM base AS production`

In the production stage, we copy the virtual environment from the builder stage and the project source code into the final image. We then set the working directory to the project source code and expose the port the application listens on. Finally, we define the command to run the application.

```dockerfile
ENV FASTAPI_ENV=production
COPY --from=builder $VENV_PATH $VENV_PATH
COPY ./app /app
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
```

Using this Dockerfile pattern, we are able to avoid installing poetry in the final image. In fact, as we are only copying in the previously installed production dependencies and source code, the final stage is extremely fast, even in the event the project source changes.

Your project may require additional tweaks to this Dockerfile, but if you are a poetry user, this is a great starting point for efficiently building your project with Docker. Consider adding an additional development stage for development dependencies and adding more stages for linting, testing, or other tasks as needed.
