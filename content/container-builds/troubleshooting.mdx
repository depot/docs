## Resetting build cache for a project

Each project in Depot represents a cache namespace shared among all systems and users that build it. The cache allows certain steps in your `Dockerfile` to be skipped in subsequent runs if their associated layer hasn't changed since the last time it was built. There can be times when you want to purge this cache.

- The build is hung because of a deadlock in BuildKit
- A builder isn't coming online to serve the build request
- The build cache is full and needs to be cleared

We optimize Depot so that these issues rarely happen. However, if you see any of these issues, you can reset the build cache for a project. Resetting the build cache purges the cache volume and launches a new build machine with a clean slate. You can reset the build cache for a project via these steps:

1. Go to the project's `Settings` page
2. Click the `Reset build cache` button at the bottom

## Multi-platform/multi-architecture image has a 3rd image with platform `unknown/unknown`

Docker introduced a new [provenance feature](https://docs.docker.com/build/attestations/slsa-provenance/) that tracks some info about the build itself, and it's implemented by attaching the data to the final image "manifest list". Many registries like GitHub Container Registry display the provenance data as an `unknown/unknown` image architecture. If you don't care about provenance or want a cleaner list in your registry, you can disable provenance during your image build.

```bash
depot build --provenance false
```

### Disabling provenance when using `depot/build-push-action` or `depot/bake-action`

You can set `provenance` to `false` in your workflow step to disable provenance.

```yaml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    ...
    provenance: false
    ...
```
