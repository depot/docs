Get faster container image builds by replacing `docker build` with `depot build`.

For faster GitHub Actions, see [GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/quickstart).

## Install the Depot CLI

### macOS

Install the Depot CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

### Linux

Install the Depot CLI with the installation script.

Install the latest version:

```shell
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh
```

To install a specific version, replace `VERSION_NUMBER` with the version you want to install:

```shell
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s VERSION_NUMBER
```

### All platforms

Download the binary file for your platform from the [Depot CLI releases page](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases) in GitHub.

## Create a Depot organization

Organizations are the top level entity in your Depot account for usage and billing. You can use an organization to represent a company, a team, or a customer.

To continue with your current organization, skip to the next section.

To create a new organization, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Depot dashboard](/orgs).
2. Click on the current organization name, then select **Switch organization > Create a new organization**.
3. Enter an organization name.
4. Click **Create organization**.
5. Click **New project** and select your region, cache storage policy, and connection.

## Run a local build

The [`depot build` command](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) accepts the same parameters as the `docker build` command.

```shell
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

When you run `depot build` locally for the first time, you're prompted to do the following:

- authenticate with Depot
- choose the project for your build
- save the project in a `depot.json` file in your repository (to remember your project for future builds)

## Run a build in CI

Depot integrates with any CI provider. Use the following guides to help you get started:

- [AWS CodeBuild](/docs/container-builds/reference/aws-codebuild)
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](/docs/container-builds/reference/bitbucket-pipelines)
- [Buildkite](/docs/container-builds/reference/buildkite)
- [CircleCI](/docs/container-builds/reference/circleci)
- [GitHub Actions](/docs/container-builds/reference/github-actions)
- [GitLab CI](/docs/container-builds/reference/gitlab-ci)
- [Google Cloud Build](/docs/container-builds/reference/google-cloud-build)
- [Jenkins](/docs/container-builds/reference/jenkins)
- [Travis CI](/docs/container-builds/reference/travis-ci)

## Add a build minute usage cap

Organizations have unlimited monthly build minutes by default.

To make costs predictable, configure a usage cap for your organization:

1. Log in to your [Depot dashboard](/orgs) and select your organization.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. In the **Usage caps** section, click **Limit build minutes**.
4. Enter the number of minutes the organization is allowed to use in a month in the **Container Build Minutes** field.
5. Click **Update limit**.

When your organization reaches the build limit, builds won't start until the next billing period or until you raise the limit.
