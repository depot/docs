# Get started with Depot

Transform your Docker builds from slow to **lightning fast** in under 5 minutes. We'll show you how to replace `docker build` with `depot build` for up to 40x faster container builds.

## See the speed difference yourself

Let's start with the most important part â€” seeing Depot's speed in action. If you have a Dockerfile in your current directory, you can try Depot immediately:

```shell
depot build -t myapp:latest .
```

**First time running this?** Depot will prompt you to authenticate and select a project.

## Install the Depot CLI

Choose your platform and install the CLI:

### Mac
```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

### Linux
```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh
```

### Other platforms
Download the binary directly from [our latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## Set up your first project

Every Depot build needs a project. Think of projects as isolated build environments for your repositories.

### Create your organization

Organizations represent your company or team in Depot:

1. **Log in** to your [Depot account](https://depot.dev/sign-in)
2. **Click "Create Organization"**
3. **Enter your organization name**
4. **Click "Create organization"**

### Create your first project  

![Screenshot of project creation form](/content/assets/create-project.png)

1. **Click "New project"** 
2. **Choose your preferred region** (closer to you = faster builds)
3. **Set your cache storage policy** (50 GB default works great to start)
4. **Click "Create project"**

**Not ready to create a project yet?** Every organization comes with a `default` project you can use immediately.

## Build something fast

Now for the fun part â€” let's see those speed improvements in action.

### Your first super-fast build

Navigate to any directory with a Dockerfile and run:

```shell
depot build -t myapp:latest .
```

**What you'll see:**
1. **Authentication prompt** (first time only)
2. **Project selection** (or automatic if you have a `depot.json` file)
3. **Lightning-fast build progress** with aggressive caching
4. **Build completion** in seconds instead of minutes

```shell
Please visit the following URL in your browser to authenticate the CLI:

    https://depot.dev/cli/authorize/authkey

Successfully authenticated!

Selected project depot-project (your_project_id)

Create a depot.json file to remember this project for future builds? â–¸Yes  No
```

### Make it even faster with persistent configuration

Depot will create a depot.json file in your current directory. This remembers your project for future builds.

**Alternative:** Set the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable instead of using a `depot.json` file.

## Bring speed to your CI pipeline

Ready to accelerate your entire CI/CD workflow? Depot works with **any CI provider** with minimal changes to your existing workflows.

### Popular CI integrations

We have specific guides for the most common CI providers:

- **[GitHub Actions](/docs/container-builds/reference/github-actions)** â€” Also try our 3x faster GitHub Actions runners
- **[GitLab CI](/docs/container-builds/reference/gitlab-ci)** â€” Drop-in replacement for your docker:dind jobs
- **[CircleCI](/docs/container-builds/reference/circleci)** â€” Works with their Docker executors
- **[AWS CodeBuild](/docs/container-builds/reference/aws-codebuild)** â€” Perfect for AWS-native workflows

### Quick CI setup

Most CI integrations follow this pattern:

```shell
# Install Depot CLI in your CI environment
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Replace docker build with depot build
depot build -t myapp:latest .
```

**Authentication in CI:** Use `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable for seamless CI authentication.

![Screenshot showing where to generate project tokens in Depot UI](/content/assets/generate-project-token.png)

**To generate your project token:**
1. Go to your [projects list](/projects).
2. Click on your project.
3. In the Project Details page, click **Settings**.
4. Scroll down to the **Project Tokens** section, and click **Create Token**.
5. Copy the generated token to your CI environment variables.

## Alternative: Use with existing Docker commands

Prefer to keep your existing `docker build` commands? Configure Depot as a Docker CLI plugin:

```shell
depot configure-docker
```

This lets your existing `docker build` commands automatically use Depot's acceleration behind the scenes.

## What's next?

ðŸŽ‰ **Congratulations!** You're now building containers up to 40x faster with Depot.

### Explore more acceleration

- **[Try our GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview)** â€” 3x faster, half the cost
- **[Set up universal build caching](/docs/cache/overview)** â€” Speed up Go, Rust, Node.js, and more
- **[Explore our container registry](/docs/registry/overview)** â€” Global CDN for instant image pulls

### Optimize your setup

- **[Advanced build configuration](/docs/container-builds/overview)** â€” Multi-platform builds, build arguments, and more
- **[Team collaboration features](/docs/container-builds/overview#sharing-builds)** â€” Share cache across your entire team
- **[Usage monitoring and limits](#usage-monitoring)** â€” Keep track of your acceleration

## Usage monitoring

Keep an eye on your build performance and costs:

![Gif of Depot dashboard](/content/assets/dashboard.gif)

### Set usage limits (optional)

Want to avoid unexpected charges? Set a monthly build minute cap:

![Set Usage Cap](/content/assets/usage-cap.png)

1. Go to your organization settings.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. In the **Usage** section choose:
   - **Unlimited** (default) â€” Build as much as you need
   - **Limit build minutes** â€” Set a monthly cap

Most teams start with unlimited and adjust based on their usage patterns.
