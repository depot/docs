Get faster container image builds by replacing `docker build` with `depot build` using the Depot CLI. If you want to trigger Depot container builds from GitHub Actions, see the [GitHub Actions integration guide](/docs/container-builds/integrations/github-actions).

## Prerequisites

You'll need a [Depot account](https://depot.dev/sign-up).

## Install the Depot CLI

Install the [Depot CLI](/docs/cli/reference) on your machine to run local builds.

- **macOS**

  Install the Depot CLI with Homebrew:

      ```shell
      brew install depot/tap/depot
      ```

- **Linux**

  Install the Depot CLI with the installation script:

      ```shell
      curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh
      ```

- **All platforms**

  Download the binary file for your platform from the [Depot CLI releases page](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases) in GitHub.

## Run a local build

The [`depot build` command](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) accepts the same parameters as the `docker build` command.

```shell
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

When you run `depot build` locally for the first time, you're prompted to do the following:

- authenticate with Depot
- choose the project for your build
- save the project in a `depot.json` file in your repository (to remember your project for future builds)

## Run a build in CI

Depot integrates with any CI provider. Use the following guides to help you get started:

- [AWS CodeBuild](/docs/container-builds/integrations/aws-codebuild)
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](/docs/container-builds/integrations/bitbucket-pipelines)
- [Buildkite](/docs/container-builds/integrations/buildkite)
- [CircleCI](/docs/container-builds/integrations/circleci)
- [GitHub Actions](/docs/container-builds/integrations/github-actions)
- [GitLab CI](/docs/container-builds/integrations/gitlab-ci)
- [Google Cloud Build](/docs/container-builds/integrations/google-cloud-build)
- [Jenkins](/docs/container-builds/integrations/jenkins)
- [Travis CI](/docs/container-builds/integrations/travis-ci)

## Add a build minute usage cap

Organizations have unlimited monthly build minutes by default. To make costs predictable, configure a usage cap for your organization:

1. Log in to your [Depot dashboard](/orgs) and select your organization.
2. Click **Settings**.
3. In the **Usage caps** section, click **Limit build minutes**.
4. Enter the number of minutes the organization is allowed to use in a month in the **Container Build Minutes** field.
5. Click **Update limit**.

When your organization reaches the build limit, builds won't start until the next billing period or until you raise the limit.
