Below is a guide to leveraging Depot for up to 40x faster container image builds with a literal drop-in replacement for `docker build`.

We also offer managed GitHub Actions Runners with 10x faster caching. You can get started with our runners in our [GitHub Actions Overview docs](/docs/github-actions/overview).

## Installing the `depot` CLI

For Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

For Linux, you can install the CLI with [our installation script](https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh):

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s 2.96.2
```

For all other platforms, you can download the binary directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## Creating a Depot organization

Organizations are the top level entity in Depot. They typically represent a single company or team. Billing details are attached to an organization.

1. Login to your Depot account to get to your [list of organizations](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Organization` button
3. Enter an organization name
4. Click `Create organization`
5. Click `New project` and specify your preferred region, cache storage policy, and connection.

If you're not quite ready to create your own project, every organization comes pre-configured with a `default` project that you can use for any container image build. The default project is placed in our US East region with a cache storage policy of 50 GB per image architecture. If you'd like to change those defaults, you can go into the Project > Settings and make any changes.

## Running a local build

There are two options for running local builds with Depot.

#### Using Depot with our `depot build` command

Our `depot build` command is a drop-in replacement for your existing `docker build` command.

Once you've created your project in the Depot app, you can run `depot build` to build your Docker image. The [`build` command](/docs/cli/reference#depot-build) takes all of the same parameters as your normal `docker build` command.

```shell
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

Your first `depot build` locally will ask you to authenticate with Depot and choose the project for your build. The CLI will prompt you to save this project in a `depot.json` file in your repository. This file is used to remember your project for future builds.

**Note: You can also specify a `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable instead of saving a `depot.json` file.**

#### Using Depot with your existing `docker build` command

There is the option to configure your existing `docker build` commmands to leverage Depot behind the scenes for the build. This is done by configuring Depot as a plugin for the Docker CLI. You can see our [`depot configure-docker` docs](/docs/cli/reference#depot-configure-docker) for more information.

## Running a build in CI

Integrating Depot into your CI workflow is a very similar process. Depot works with any CI provider. You can find guides for our most popular providers:

- [AWS CodeBuild](/docs/container-builds/reference/aws-codebuild)
- [Bitbucket Pipelines](/docs/container-builds/reference/bitbucket-pipelines)
- [Buildkite](/docs/container-builds/reference/buildkite)
- [CircleCI](/docs/container-builds/reference/circleci)
- [GitHub Actions](/docs/container-builds/reference/github-actions)
- [GitLab CI](/docs/container-builds/reference/gitlab-ci)
- [Google Cloud Build](/docs/container-builds/reference/google-cloud-build)
- [Jenkins](/docs/container-builds/reference/jenkins)
- [Travis CI](/docs/container-builds/reference/travis-ci)

## Adding a build minute usage cap

By default, an organization is allowed to use unlimited build minutes in a month. However, you can configure a usage cap on your organization to avoid runaway costs.

1. Go to your [organizations inside of Depot](/orgs) and select your organization
2. Click on the `Settings` button
3. Under the `Usage caps` section you can choose between two options:

- **Unlimited**: By default organizations are configured to use unlimited build minutes in a month
- **Limit build minutes**: You can enter a fixed number of build minutes that your organization is allowed to use in a month. Once the limit is reached, builds will fail to start until the limit is raised or reset.
