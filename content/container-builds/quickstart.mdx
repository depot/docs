# Get started with Depot

Transform your Docker builds from slow to **lightning fast** in under 5 minutes. 

This guide shows you how to replace `docker build` with `depot build` for up to 40x faster container builds.

![Before and after build time comparison](/content/assets/slow-vs-fast.svg)

## Experience the speed difference 

If you have a Dockerfile in your current directory, you can try Depot immediately:

```shell
depot build -t myapp:latest .
```

**First time running this?** Depot will prompt you to authenticate and select a project.

## Install the Depot CLI

macOS:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

Linux:

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh
```

Other platforms:

Download the binary directly from the [latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## Set up a project

Projects are isolated build environments for repositories. Every Depot build needs a project.

### Create an organization

In Depot, an organization represents a company or team.

1. Log in to your [Depot account](https://depot.dev/sign-in).
2. Click `Create Organization`.
3. Enter your organization name.
4. Click `Create organization`.

### Create a project  

![Depot project creation form showing region selection and cache storage settings](/content/assets/create-project.png)

Click `New project`. In the dialog:

- Select a region (closer to you = faster builds).
- Set a cache storage policy (50 GB default works great to start).
- Click `Create project`.

**Not ready to create a project yet?** Every organization comes with a `default` project you can use immediately.

## Build something fast

Time to see Depot's speed in action.

### Your first super-fast build

Navigate to any directory with a Dockerfile and run:

```shell
depot build -t myapp:latest .
```

What to expect:

- Authenticate (first time only).
- Select a project (automatic if you have a `depot.json` file).
- Watch the lightning-fast build with aggressive caching.
- Complete in seconds instead of minutes.

```shell
Please visit the following URL in your browser to authenticate the CLI:

    https://depot.dev/cli/authorize/authkey

Successfully authenticated!

Selected project depot-project (your_project_id)

Create a depot.json file to remember this project for future builds? ▸Yes  No
```

### Faster future builds with persistent configuration

Depot will create a `depot.json` file in your current directory to remember your project for future builds.

Alternatively, set the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable.

## Faster CI builds

Ready to accelerate your entire CI/CD workflow? Depot works with **any CI provider** with minimal changes to your existing workflows.

### Popular CI integrations

Depot provides platform-specific setup guides for popular CI providers.

- **[GitHub Actions](/docs/container-builds/reference/github-actions)**: Also try our 3x faster GitHub Actions runners
- **[GitLab CI](/docs/container-builds/reference/gitlab-ci)**: Drop-in replacement for `docker:dind` jobs
- **[CircleCI](/docs/container-builds/reference/circleci)**: Works with CircleCI Docker executors
- **[AWS CodeBuild](/docs/container-builds/reference/aws-codebuild)**: Perfect for AWS-native workflows

### Quick CI setup

Most CI integrations follow this pattern:

```shell
# Install Depot CLI in your CI environment
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Replace docker build with depot build
depot build -t myapp:latest .
```

**Authenticate in CI** using the `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable.

**Authentication in CI:** Use `DEPOT_TOKEN` environment variable for seamless CI authentication.

![Screenshot showing where to generate project tokens in the Depot UI](/content/assets/generate-project-token.png)

To generate a project token:

1. Click [`projects`](/projects) in the sidebar.
2. Click the project name.
3. In the project details page, select the `Settings` tab.
4. Scroll down to `Project Tokens` and click `Create token`.
5. Copy the generated token to your CI environment variables.

## Alternative: Use with existing Docker commands

Prefer to keep your existing `docker build` commands? Configure Depot as a Docker CLI plugin:

```shell
depot configure-docker
```

Existing `docker build` commands automatically use Depot's acceleration behind the scenes.

## What's next?

You're now building containers up to 40x faster with Depot. Here's how to get even more value from the platform.

### Explore more acceleration

- **[Try our GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview)**: 3x faster, half the cost
- **[Set up universal build caching](/docs/cache/overview)**: Speed up Go, Rust, Node.js, and more
- **[Explore the Depot container registry](/docs/registry/overview)**: Global CDN for instant image pulls

### Optimize your setup

- **[Advanced build configuration](/docs/container-builds/overview)**: Multi-platform builds, build arguments, and more
- **[Team collaboration features](/docs/container-builds/overview#sharing-builds)**: Share cache across your entire team
- **[Usage monitoring and limits](#usage-monitoring)**: Monitor build performance and costs

## Monitor usage

Keep an eye on your build performance and costs:

![Gif of Depot dashboard](/content/assets/dashboard.gif)

### Set usage limits (optional)

Want to avoid unexpected charges? Set a monthly build minute cap.

![Depot organization settings page showing how to set monthly build minute limits to control costs](/content/assets/usage-cap.png)

Set your usage cap in organization settings.

- Click `Settings` in the sidebar.
- In the `Usage` section, select one of these options:
   - **Unlimited** (default): Build as much as you need.
   - **Limit build minutes**: Set a monthly cap.

Most teams start with unlimited build minutes and adjust based on usage patterns.
