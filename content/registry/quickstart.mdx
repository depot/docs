This guide walks you through how you can get started with the Depot Registry, a high-performance container image registry that is included with every Depot project. Here we will show how you can use it to push arbitrary images into it, save your image builds to it, and pull your images from anywhere.

## 1. Installing the `depot` CLI

For Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

For Linux, you can install the CLI with [our installation script](https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh):

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s 2.96.2
```

For all other platforms, you can download the binary directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## 2. Authenticating to the registry

To authenticate to the Depot Registry, you can use the `docker login` command with your Depot access token of choice if you'd like to `docker push` and `docker pull`. The registry supports authenticating with user, project, trust relationships and organization access tokens, as well as pull tokens. See the [authentication methods](/docs/cli/authentication) for more details on generating these tokens.

When authenticating to the registry, set the username to `x-token` and the password to your chosen token:

```shell
docker login registry.depot.dev -u x-token -p <depot-token>
```

**Note:** For `depot pull` and `depot push`, the Depot CLI uses your CLI credentials to authenticate to the registry and `docker login` is not required.

## 3. Creating a Depot project to initialize your registry

A container registry is enabled on a per-project basis. To create a new project, you can use the Depot CLI:

```shell
depot projects create container-registry-test
```

Or you can login to your Depot account and create a new project in your organization.

## 4. Push an image to the Depot Registry

You can push any image to the Depot Registry using the `docker push` command. First, tag the image with your project ID and the desired tag (e.g., `latest`):

```shell
docker tag <local-image> registry.depot.dev/<your-project-id>:my-image
docker push registry.depot.dev/<your-project-id>:my-image
```

## 5. Save a container image build to the Depot Registry

If you are using Depot to build your container images, you can save the build directly to the Depot Registry using the `--save` flag with the `depot build` command:

```shell
depot build --save --save-tag my-image .
```

The additional `--save-tag` flag is optional, but it's useful for saving custom tags for your builds. You can use these custom tags in place of a build ID when trying to pull down a specific build.

## 6. Pulling an image from the Depot Registry

You can pull an image from the Depot Registry using either the `docker pull` command or the `depot pull` command.

### Using `docker pull`

To make use of `docker pull`, make sure you have authenticated your local Docker daemon to the registry with `docker login` as shown above.

Then you can pull the image using the following command:

```shell
docker pull registry.depot.dev/<your-project-id>:my-image
```

### Using `depot pull`

When using the `depot pull` command, you do not need to authenticate with `docker login` first, as the CLI uses your existing Depot CLI credentials to authenticate to the registry.

You can specify either a Depot build ID or a custom tag that you saved when pulling the image:

```shell
depot pull --project <your-project-id> <build-id>
depot pull --project <your-project-id> my-image
```

**Note:** You can omit the `<build-id>` and `<tag>` arguments to display an interactive list of builds to choose from.

### Pulling with Kubernetes

To pull a build from the Depot Registry in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the `kubectl` command to [create a secret with the Docker registry credentials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/), then create a Kubernetes deployment that uses the secret to pull the image.

```shell
kubectl create secret docker-registry regcred \
  --docker-server=registry.depot.dev \
  --docker-username=x-token \
  --docker-password=<any project, org, or user access token>
```

## 7. Copying an image from the Depot Registry to another registry

You can copy an image that was built with `depot build --save` from the Depot Registry to another registry using the `depot push` command to push the saved image build in the registry to another registry of your choosing.

You will need to make sure you have authenticated to the target registry with `docker login` first.

```shell
depot push --project <your-project-id> -t <your-image-registry>:<tag> <build-id>
```
