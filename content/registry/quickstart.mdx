## Saving

To save a Depot build in the Depot Registry, use the `--save` flag when running `depot build`:

```bash
depot build --save --metadata-file=build.json ...
```

The `--metadata-file` flag is optional, but it's useful for capturing the metadata about the build, such as the build ID and project ID. You can use the `buildID` property in that file to pull or push the build later.

```json
{
  "depot.build": {
    "buildID": "your-build-id",
    "projectID": "your-project-id"
  }
}
```

For example, you could pull the image by the build ID in the metadata file via the `depot pull` command:

```bash
depot pull $(cat build.json | jq -r .\[\"depot.build\"\].buildID)
```

If you are using GitHub Actions with the `depot/build-push-action`, you can add `save: true` as an input:

```yaml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  with:
    save: true
    project: <your-project-id>
```

To pull the image back or push it to another registry, you will need the build ID. The build ID is printed in the output of `depot build` and is automatically set as an output of the `depot/build-push-action`:

```yaml
- uses: depot/build-push-action@v1
  id: build
  with:
    save: true
    project: <your-project-id>

- name: Print build ID
  run: echo ${{ steps.build.outputs.build-id }}
```

## Pulling

To pull a build that has been saved in the Depot Registry, you can use the `depot pull` command with the build ID, and the `-t` flag to choose the image name/tag:

```bash
depot pull <build-id> -t <image-name>:<tag>
```

You can also omit the `<build-id>` argument to display an interactive list of builds to choose for pulling.

### Pulling with Docker

To pull a build from the Depot Registry using the Docker CLI, you must first authenticate. You can do this by running the `docker login` command or by using any of the [other authentication methods](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/login/).

```bash
docker login registry.depot.dev -u x-token -p <any project, org, or user access token>
```

Learn more about Depot authentication tokens in the [authentication guide](/docs/cli/authentication).

After authenticating, you can pull the build using the `docker pull` command:

```bash
docker pull registry.depot.dev/PROJECT_ID:BUILD_ID
```

### Pulling with Kubernetes

To pull a build from the Depot Registry in a Kubernetes cluster, you can use the `kubectl` command to [create a secret with the Docker registry credentials](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/pull-image-private-registry/), then create a Kubernetes deployment that uses the secret to pull the image.

```bash
kubectl create secret depot-registry regcred --docker-server=registry.depot.dev --docker-username=x-token --docker-password=<any project, org, or user access token>
```

## Pushing

To push a build that has been saved in the Depot Registry to your own registry, you can use the `depot push` command with the build ID, and the `-t` flag to choose the image name/tag:

```bash
depot push <build-id> -t <image-name>:<tag>
```

Some notes:

1. Like adding the `--push` flag to `depot build`, the `depot push` command uses registry credentials stored in Docker when pushing to registries. If you have not already authenticated with your registry, you should do so with `docker login` before running `depot push`.

2. Similar to `depot pull`, you can omit the `<build-id>` argument to display an interactive list of builds to choose from.

3. `depot push` will push the image to the target registry directly from the remote infrastructure, without downloading it to the CLI first, to avoid unnecessary data transfer.
