The **Depot Registry** is a full-featured container registry for storing, managing, and distributing your Docker images. It provides a complete solution for image management throughout your development lifecycle. With Depot Registry, you can securely store your container images, easily distribute them across your infrastructure, and seamlessly integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines.

Take a look at the [quickstart](/docs/registry/quickstart) to get started.

## How does it work?

Depot Registry provides a central repository for all your container images. You can get images into your registry via our container build service by passing the `--save` flag as part of your `depot build`. Or you can push images into your container registry via your traditional `docker push` command.

Behind the scenes, Depot Registry is backed by a global CDN to distribute layer blobs efficiently, making it significantly faster to pull and push large images. This distributed architecture ensures optimal performance regardless of your geographical location.

If you want to distribute your images across multiple registries, you can use [`depot push`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-push) to push an image from your Depot Registry to another registry of your choice. When pushing an image to another registry, the transfer happens directly from the Depot infrastructure to your target registry, avoiding unnecessary downloads to your local machine and reducing data transfer times.

You can also use [`depot pull`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-pull) to download any image from your Depot Registry into your local, CI, or production environments.

To view what is in your registry, we've built out a Registry dashboard in Depot that allows you to filter and search across your images:

## Use-cases

Depot Registry is a full-fledged registry that is directly integrated with your container image builds. You can use it for a variety of use-cases like:

- **Primary registry** - Use Depot Registry as your primary container registry for all of your container images, even ones you're not building with Depot.
- **Local development** - Pull images directly to your local machine for testing and development. The global CDN ensures fast downloads regardless of your location.
- **Cross environment consistency** - Build your image once on Depot, save it to the registry, and then promote that image across your development, staging, and production environments without having to rebuild it.
- **Working with large images** - The layer blobs in a Docker image can be quite large when working with large images. Pulling and pushing them down from a single builder can be time-consuming. Due to its global distribution mechanism, the Depot Registry can quickly pull and push large images.

## Authentication and Permissions

The Depot Registry supports authentication using various types of Depot tokens. All token types provide both push and pull access to the registry, with the exception of pull tokens which are read-only:

- **User access tokens** - Full push and pull permissions for any project in any organization you have access to
- **Project tokens** - Full push and pull permissions for the specific project they're associated with
- **Organization tokens** - Full push and pull permissions for any project within the organization
- **Trust relationship tokens** - Full push and pull permissions for the project when issued via OIDC trust relationships
- **Pull tokens** - Read-only access for pulling images only (generated via `depot pull-token`)

### Authentication for `docker` CLI

If you want to use Depot Registry with Docker CLI tools, you can authenticate using the Depot tokens above. When you authenticate to the registry for things like `docker pull` or `docker push`, you will need to set the username to `x-token` and the password to your chosen token above.

## Pricing

Depot Registry storage costs are part of our $0.20/GB storage pricing. See our [pricing page](/pricing) for more details. We don't charge for network transfer of your images to and from Depot Registry.

## Image Retention

By default, builds saved in the Depot Registry persist for **7 days** from when they are pushed, after which they are deleted. You can configure this retention period to be longer by updating the policy on the **Project Settings** page for a project that has the registry enabled.

Possible values for the retention policy are:

- **1 day**
- **7 days** (default)
- **14 days**
- **30 days**
- **Unlimited**

You can also individually delete images from the Depot Registry on the Registry dashboard.
