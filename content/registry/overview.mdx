The **Depot Registry** is a full-featured container registry for storing, managing, and distributing your Docker images. It provides a complete solution for image management throughout your development lifecycle. With Depot Registry, you can securely store your container images, easily distribute them across your infrastructure, and seamlessly integrate with your existing CI/CD pipelines.

Take a look at the [quickstart](/docs/registry/quickstart) to get started.

## How does it work?

Depot Registry provides a central repository for all your container images. Builds configured with the `--save` flag will be automatically stored in the Depot Registry and associated with your configured project. These images are securely stored and readily available to pull down for deployment to any environment, from local development to production.

Behind the scenes, Depot Registry is backed by a global CDN to distribute layer blobs efficiently, making it significantly faster to pull and push large images. This distributed architecture ensures optimal performance regardless of your geographical location.

If you want to distribute your images across multiple registries, you can use [`depot push`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-push) to push an image from your Depot Registry to another registry of your choice. When pushing an image to another registry, the transfer happens directly from the Depot infrastructure to your target registry, avoiding unnecessary downloads to your local machine and reducing data transfer times.

You can also use [`depot pull`](/docs/cli/reference#depot-pull) to download any image from your Depot Registry into your local, CI, or production environments.

To view what is in your registry, we've built out a Registry dashboard in Depot that allows you to filter and search across your images:

## Use-cases

Depot Registry is a full-fledged registry that is directly integrated with your container image builds. You can use it for a variety of use-cases like:

- **Primary registry** - Use Depot Registry as your primary container registry for all images that you're building with our [remote container build service](/docs/container-builds/overview).
- **Integration testing a built image** - If you run a set of matrix integration tests on your final image across multiple CI workflows, registries can save you from running a build for each workflow. Instead, you can run a single build, save it in the Depot Registry, and then pull it down to each workflow to run the integration tests.
- **Local development** - Pull images directly to your local machine for testing and development. The global CDN ensures fast downloads regardless of your location.
- **Cross environment consistency** - Build your image once on Depot, save it to the registry, and then promote that image across your development, staging, and production environments without having to rebuild it.
- **Working with large images** - The layer blobs in a Docker image can be quite large when working with large images. Pulling and pushing them down from a single builder can be time-consuming. Due to its global distribution mechanism, the Depot Registry can quickly pull and push large images.

### Upcoming features

We're working on additional features for Depot Registry. If you're interested in Beta testing any of these, please reach out to us [via email](mailto:help@depot.dev) or [drop us a message in Discord](https://discord.gg/MMPqYSgDCg):

- Vulnerability Scanning - Automatically scan your images for security vulnerabilities and get detailed reports.
- Image Signing - Support for signing images to verify authenticity and integrity.
- Registry API - Comprehensive API for programmatic registry access and management.

## Pricing

Depot Registry storage costs are part of our $0.20/GB storage pricing. See our [pricing page](/pricing) for more details. We don't charge for network transfer of your images to and from Depot Registry.

## Image Retention

By default, builds saved in the Depot Registry persist for **7 days** from when they are pushed, after which they are deleted. You can configure this retention period to be longer by updating the policy on the **Project Settings** page for a project that has the registry enabled.

Possible values for the retention policy are:

- **7 days** (default)
- **14 days**
- **30 days**
- **Unlimited**

You can also individually delete images from the Depot Registry on the Registry dashboard.
