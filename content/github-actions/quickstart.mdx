Connect your Depot organization to GitHub and configure your GitHub Actions to use Depot managed runners.

## Create a Depot organization

Organizations are the top level entity in your Depot account for usage and billing. You can use an organization to represent a company, a team, or a customer.

To continue with your current organization, skip to the next section.

To create a new organization, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your [Depot dashboard](/orgs).
2. Click on the current organization name, then select **Switch organization > Create a new organization**.
3. Enter an organization name.
4. Click **Create organization**.
5. Click **New project** and select your region, cache storage policy, and connection.

## Connect to GitHub

To configure Depot GitHub Action Runners, connect to your GitHub organization and install the Depot GitHub App:

1. Log in to your [Depot dashboard](/orgs).
2. Click **GitHub Actions**.
3. Click **Connect to GitHub**.\
   The install form opens in GitHub.
4. Install or install and authorize the Depot app.

#### Private repository approval

Some GitHub organizations require an Organization Administrator to approve the new Depot GitHub app before jobs can run on Depot runners. You can confirm the app is active and approved in the **GitHub Actions** section of your Depot dashboard.

#### Public repository permissions

If you're using Depot runners with public repositories, update your Actions runner group to allow runners to be used in public repositories. In the **Actions > Runner groups** section in your GitHub organization settings, select **Allow public repositories**.

## Configure your GitHub Actions workflow

Depot supports a variety of runner types and sizes, including Intel and Arm runners with up to 64 CPUs. For a full list of available labels, see the [runner type docs](/docs/github-actions/runner-types).

To configure your GitHub Actions to use Depot runners, specify the runner label in your workflow YAML file under `.github/workflows/`:

```diff
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
-    runs-on: ubuntu-22.04
+    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-22.04
    steps:
      ...
```
