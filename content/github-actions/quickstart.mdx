Connect your Depot organization to GitHub and configure your GitHub Actions to use Depot managed runners.

## Prerequisites

You'll need a [Depot account](https://depot.dev/sign-up).

## Connect to GitHub

To configure Depot GitHub Action Runners, you must have the organization owner role. Connect to your GitHub organization and install the Depot GitHub App:

1. Log in to your [Depot dashboard](/orgs).
2. Click **GitHub Actions**.
3. Click **Connect to GitHub**.\
   The install form opens in GitHub.
4. Install or install and authorize the Depot app.

#### Private repository approval

Some GitHub organizations require an Organization Administrator to approve the new Depot GitHub app before jobs can run on Depot runners. To confirm the app is active and approved:

1. Log in to your [Depot dashboard](/orgs).
2. Click **Settings**.
3. In the **GitHub Actions runners** section, view **GitHub Connections**.

#### Public repository permissions

If you're using Depot runners with public repositories, update your Actions runner group to allow runners to be used in public repositories. In the **Actions > Runner groups** section in your GitHub organization settings, select **Allow public repositories**.

## Configure your GitHub Actions workflow

Depot supports a variety of [runner types and sizes](/docs/github-actions/runner-types), including Intel and Arm runners with up to 64 CPUs.

To configure your GitHub Actions to use Depot runners, specify the runner label in your workflow YAML file under `.github/workflows/`. For example:

```diff
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
-    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
+    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      ...
```

## View GitHub Actions jobs

To view jobs that have run on Depot runners, go to the [GitHub Actions page](/orgs/_/github-actions) in your Depot dashboard.
