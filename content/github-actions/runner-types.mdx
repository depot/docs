Depot offers several different types of GitHub Actions runners, depending on your CI job needs. You can choose the type on a per-job basis by specifying the `runs-on` key in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-22.04
```

**Note**: We support the `depot-ubuntu-latest-*` alias for `depot-ubuntu-22.04-*` if you want to use the latest Ubuntu version.

**RAM Disk Reserved**:
Most Depot runners have a portion of memory reserved for a RAM disk. The RAM disk cache acts as buffer before writing to the NVMe SSD for incredibly fast I/O operations.

## Intel runners

Intel runners use AMD EC2 instances. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 250 MB/s throughput.

The following labels are available:

| Label                      | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Per-minute price | RAM Disk Reserved |
