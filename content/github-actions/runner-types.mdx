Depot offers several different types of GitHub Actions runners, depending on your CI job needs. You can choose the type on a per-job basis by specifying the runner label in your `.github/workflows/*.yaml` file:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-24.04
```

**Note**: We support the `depot-ubuntu-latest-*` alias for `depot-ubuntu-24.04-*` if you prefer to use an evergreen Ubuntu version.

**In-memory Disk Accelerator**:

Depot runners reserve a portion of the memory on the runner host for a disk accelerator, backed by a RAM disk. The accelerator acts as buffer between reading and writing to the root disk, which allows Actions runs to perform incredibly fast I/O operations, much quicker than the physical disk would allow.

## Intel runners

Intel runners use AMD EC2 instances. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 250 MB/s throughput.

The following labels are available:

| Label                      | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Disk accelerator size | Per-minute price | Minutes multiplier |

## macOS runners

**Status: Beta**

macOS runners use instances with M2 chips running macOS 14. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 1000 MB/s throughput. Like the Linux runners, the macOS runners also have a disk accelerator.

**Note**: These runners are only available on the [Startup plan](/pricing) during beta.

The following labels are available:

| Label                | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Per-minute price |
| :------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :--------------- |
| `depot-macos-latest` | 8    | 24 GB  | 150GB     | $0.08            |
| `depot-macos-14`     | 8    | 24 GB  | 150GB     | $0.08            |

## Windows runners

**Status: Beta**

Windows runners use instances with Intel chips running Windows Server 2022. These runners don't currently have a disk accelerator (i.e. [Ultra Runners](/blog/introducing-github-actions-ultra-runners)).

The following labels are available:

| Label                      | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Per-minute price | Minutes multiplier |
| :------------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :--------------- | :----------------- |
| `depot-windows-2022-small` | 2    | 2 GB   | 100 GB    | $0.004           | 0.5x               |
| `depot-windows-2022`       | 2    | 8 GB   | 100 GB    | $0.008           | 1x                 |
| `depot-windows-2022-4`     | 4    | 16 GB  | 150 GB    | $0.016           | 2x                 |
| `depot-windows-2022-8`     | 8    | 32 GB  | 300 GB    | $0.032           | 4x                 |
| `depot-windows-2022-16`    | 16   | 64 GB  | 600 GB    | $0.064           | 8x                 |
| `depot-windows-2022-32`    | 32   | 128 GB | 1200 GB   | $0.128           | 16x                |
| `depot-windows-2022-64`    | 64   | 256 GB | 2400 GB   | $0.256           | 32x                |

## Billing

Note that on your Billing summary, costs are broken down by `Billed minutes` and `Elapsed minutes`. Here are several things to know about the difference:

- `Elapsed minutes` is the clock time spent executing your jobs.
- `Billed minutes` multiples the `Minutes multiplier` (from the table above) by the `Elapsed minutes`.
- The rate at which `Billed minutes` accumulates is based on the size of the `Minutes multiplier`.
- What you pay is the total `Billed minutes` minus the included minutes of your plan.
