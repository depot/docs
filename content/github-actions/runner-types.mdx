Depot offers several different types of GitHub Actions runners, depending on your CI job needs. You can choose the type on a per-job basis by specifying the runner label in your `.github/workflows/*.yaml` file:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-24.04
```

**Note**: We support the depot-ubuntu-latest alias for depot-ubuntu-24.04 if you prefer to use an evergreen Ubuntu version.

**In-memory Disk Accelerator**:

Depot runners reserve a portion of the memory on the runner host for a disk accelerator, backed by a RAM disk. The accelerator acts as buffer between reading and writing to the root disk, which allows Actions runs to perform incredibly fast I/O operations, much quicker than the physical disk would allow.

## Intel runners

Intel runners use AMD EC2 instances. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 250 MB/s throughput.

The following labels are available:

| Label                   | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Disk accelerator size | Per-minute price | Minutes multiplier |
| :---------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :-------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- |

## Arm runners

Arm runners use Graviton4 EC2 instances. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 250 MB/s throughput.

The following labels are available:

| Label                       | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Disk accelerator size | Per-minute price | Minutes multiplier |
| :-------------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :-------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-arm`    | 2    | 8 GB   | 100 GB    | 2GB                   | $0.004           | 1x                 |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-arm-4`  | 4    | 16 GB  | 130 GB    | 4GB                   | $0.008           | 2x                 |

| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-arm-32` | 32   | 128 GB | 200 GB    | 16GB                  | $0.064           | 16x                |
| `depot-ubuntu-24.04-arm-64` | 64   | 256 GB | 250 GB    | 32GB                  | $0.128           | 32x                |

## Ubuntu 22.04 runners

These runners use the same instances as the Ubuntu 24.04 runners.

The following labels are available:

| Label                       | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Disk accelerator size | Per-minute price | Minutes multiplier |
| :-------------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :-------------------- | :--------------- | :----------------- |

## Windows runners

Windows runners use instances with Intel chips running Windows Server 2022. These runners don't currently have a disk accelerator (i.e. [Ultra Runners](/blog/introducing-github-actions-ultra-runners)).

The following labels are available:

| Label                   | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Per-minute price | Minutes multiplier |
| :---------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :--------------- | :----------------- |
| `depot-windows-2022`    | 2    | 8 GB   | 100 GB    | $0.008           | 2x                 |
| `depot-windows-2022-4`  | 4    | 16 GB  | 130 GB    | $0.016           | 4x                 |
| `depot-windows-2022-8`  | 8    | 32 GB  | 150 GB    | $0.032           | 8x                 |
| `depot-windows-2022-16` | 16   | 64 GB  | 180 GB    | $0.064           | 16x                |
| `depot-windows-2022-32` | 32   | 128 GB | 200 GB    | $0.128           | 32x                |
| `depot-windows-2022-64` | 64   | 256 GB | 250 GB    | $0.256           | 64x                |

**Note**: Windows runners don't come equipped with Hyper-v because of an AWS limitation on EC2. Therefore, if you use things that require it like `docker`, than Depot Windows Runners are unlikely to work for you.

## macOS runners

macOS runners use instances with M2 chips running macOS 14 or macOS 15. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 1000 MB/s throughput. Like the Linux runners, the macOS runners also have a disk accelerator.

The following labels are available:

| Label                                   | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Per-minute price |
| :-------------------------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :--------------- |
| `depot-macos-15` (`depot-macos-latest`) | 8    | 24 GB  | 150GB     | $0.08            |
| `depot-macos-14`                        | 8    | 24 GB  | 150GB     | $0.08            |

**Note:** due to licensing constraints from Apple, our macOS runner capacity is not fully elastic like our other runner types. We periodically update capacity to match demand, but macOS jobs can experience longer queue times during times of high demand.

## Billing

Note that on your Billing summary, costs are broken down by `Billed minutes` and `Elapsed minutes`. Here are several things to know about the difference:

- `Elapsed minutes` is the clock time spent executing your jobs.
- `Billed minutes` multiples the `Minutes multiplier` (from the table above) by the `Elapsed minutes`.
- The rate at which `Billed minutes` accumulates is based on the size of the `Minutes multiplier`.
- What you pay is the total `Billed minutes` minus the included minutes of your plan.

_Note: We do our best to keep our images in sync with GitHub's, but there may be a slight delay between when GitHub updates their images and when we update ours. If you need a specific version of a tool or software, please check the links above to see if it's available in the image you're using._
