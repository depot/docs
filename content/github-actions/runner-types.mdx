Depot offers several different types of GitHub Actions runners, depending on your CI job needs. You can choose the type on a per-job basis by specifying the `runs-on` key in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-22.04
```

**Note**: We support the `depot-ubuntu-latest-*` alias for `depot-ubuntu-22.04-*` if you want to use the latest Ubuntu version.

**In-memory Disk Accelerator**:

Depot runners reserve a portion of the memory on the runner host for a disk accelerator, backed by a RAM disk. The accelerator acts as buffer between reading and writing to the root disk, which allows Actions runs to perform incredibly fast I/O operations much quicker than the physical disk would allow.

## Intel runners

Intel runners use AMD EC2 instances. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 250 MB/s throughput.

The following labels are available:

| Label                      | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Disk accelerator size | Per-minute price |
