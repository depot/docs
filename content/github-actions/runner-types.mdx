Depot offers several different types of GitHub Actions runners, depending on your CI job needs. You can choose the type on a per-job basis by specifying the `runs-on` key in your GitHub Actions workflow file:

```yaml
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-22.04
```

**Note**: We support the `depot-ubuntu-latest-*` alias for `depot-ubuntu-22.04-*` if you want to use the latest Ubuntu version.

**In-memory Disk Accelerator**:

Depot runners reserve a portion of the memory on the runner host for a disk accelerator, backed by a RAM disk. The accelerator acts as buffer between reading and writing to the root disk, which allows Actions runs to perform incredibly fast I/O operations much quicker than the physical disk would allow.

## Intel runners

Intel runners use AMD EC2 instances. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 250 MB/s throughput.

The following labels are available:

| Label                      | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Disk accelerator size | Per-minute price | Minutes multiplier |

## macOS runners

**Status: Beta**

macOS runners use instances with M2 chips running macOS 14. Their EBS volume is provisioned with 8000 IOPS and 1000 MB/s throughput. Like the Linux runners, the macOS runners also have a disk accelerator.

**Note**: These runners are only available on the [Startup plan](/pricing) during beta.

The following label is available:

| Label                | CPUs | Memory | Disk size | Per-minute price |
| :------------------- | :--- | :----- | :-------- | :--------------- |
| `depot-macos-latest` | 8    | 24 GB  | 150GB     | $0.08            |
| `depot-macos-14`     | 8    | 24 GB  | 150GB     | $0.08            |

## Billing

Note that on your Billing summary, costs are broken down by `Billed minutes` and `Elapsed minutes`. `Elapsed minutes` is the wall time spent executing your Jobs, `Billed minutes` multiples the `Minutes multiplier` (from the table above) to the Elapsed minutes.

Therefore, you will burn `Billed minutes` faster based on the size of the `Minutes multiplier`. Finally, what you pay is the total `Billed minutes` minus the included minutes of your Plan.
