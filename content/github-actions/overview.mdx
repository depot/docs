---

Our fully-managed GitHub Actions Runners are a simple drop-in replacement for your existing runners in any GitHub Action jobs. Our runners have 30% faster compute, 10x faster caching and are half the cost of GitHub hosted runners.

Here are a few technical and implementation details that are relevant for Depot-managed GitHub Actions runners:

- **Single tenant**: Runners are single tenant. We run your job and then kill the machine - it's never reused
- **30% faster compute**: For Intel runners, we launched with 4th Gen AMD EPYC Genoa CPUs and for Arm runners, we launched with AWS Graviton2 CPUs
- **10x faster cache**: Runners automatically integrate with our distributed cache architecture for upload and download speeds up to 1000 MiB/s on 12.5 Gbps of network throughput â€” no 10GB cache limit either
- **Per second billing**: We track builds by the second and only bill for whole minutes used at the end of the month - and we don't enforce a one minute minimum
- **No limits**: No concurrency limits, no cache size limits, and no network limits
- **Self-hostable**: We can run our optimized runners in our cloud or your AWS account for additional security and compliance

In addition, if you use Depot for faster Docker image builds via our [remote container builds](/docs/container-builds/overview), your BuildKit builder runs right next to your managed GitHub Action runner, allowing for faster CI builds by mimizing network latency and data transfer.

## Pricing

#### Runners

Depot-managed GitHub Action Runners are available on [all of our pricing plans](/pricing). Each plan includes a bucket of both Docker build minutes and GitHub Actions minutes. Business plan customers can [contact us](mailto:help@depot.dev) for custom plans.

|                                 | Developer | Startup                      |
| ------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------- |
| Docker build minutes included   | 500       | 5,000 + $0.04/minute after   |
| GitHub Actions minutes included | 2,000     | 20,000 + $0.004/minute after |

Startup plans and above can pay for additional usage on a per minute basis for both Docker image builds and GitHub Actions minutes. For both types of minutes we charge on a per-minute basis, tracked per second. We only bill for whole minutes used at the end of the month.

### Additional usage pricing for GitHub Actions minutes

The **Startup** and **Business** plans have the option to pay for additional GitHub Actions minutes on a per-minute basis. See the [runner type list](/docs/github-actions/runner-types) for the per-minute pricing for each runner type.

#### Cache storage

Our **10x faster** Github Actions Cache implementation is billed at $0.20 per GB of usage. The usage is calculated by taking a snapshot every hour and then averaging out those snapshots over the course of the month.

To manage the cache storage, every day we evict any cache entries that have not been used in the past 14 days. We plan to add functionality to allow customers to tweak this number as needed in the future.
