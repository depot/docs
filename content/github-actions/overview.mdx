Our fully-managed GitHub Actions Runners are a drop-in replacement for your existing runners in any GitHub Action jobs.

Our [Ultra Runner](/docs/github-actions/runner-types) is up to 3x faster than a GitHub-hosted runner. All runners are integrated into our cache orchestration system, so you get 10x faster caching without having to change anything in your jobs. We charge half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners, and we bill you by the second.

## Key features

### Single tenant

All builds run on ephemeral EC2 instances that are never reused. We launch a GitHub Actions runner in response to a webhook event from your organization requesting a runner for a job.

### Faster caching

Our runners are automatically integrated into our distributed cache architecture for upload and download speeds up to 1000 MiB/s on 12.5 Gbps of network throughput. We've brought 10x faster caching to GitHub Actions jobs by plugging in the same cache orchestration system that we use for our Docker image builds. You don't have to do anything to get this benefit; it's just there.

### Faster compute

Each runner is optimized for performance with our newest generation Ultra Runner that comes with a portion of memory reserved for disk. We launch with 4th Gen AMD EPYC Genoa CPUs for Intel runners and AWS Graviton2 CPUs for Arm runners.

### No limits

We don't enforce any concurrency limits, cache size limits, or network limits. You can run as many jobs as you want in parallel and we'll handle the rest.

### No branch-level cache isolation

We don't enforce cache isolation based on the branch the job is run from. Whether the branch is main or another topic branch, the cache is contributed to the same namespace making it accessible to other jobs. This allows you to be in control of your cache isolation based on how you format your cache keys.

### Cache scoped by repository

Cache entries stored in the Depot GitHub Actions Cache are scoped by repository. This means that cache entries can be read only by the same repository that saved them.

Scoping cache by repository has the following security benefits:

- Repositories don't have key collisions when using the same cache key.
- One repository can't unexpectedly read cache entries from another repository of a different trust level. For example, a public repository reading from or writing to a private repository.

### Per second billing

We track builds by the second and only bill for whole minutes used at the end of the month. We don't enforce a one minute minimum.

### Self-hostable

We can run our optimized runners in our cloud or your AWS account for additional security and compliance. We also support dedicated infrastructure and VPC peering options for something more custom to your needs.

### Custom runner images

For Business plan customers, we can create custom runner AMIs with pre-installed software tailored to your specific requirements. This is useful if you need specific tools, dependencies, or configurations that aren't included in our standard runner images. Contact us at [contact@depot.dev](mailto:contact@depot.dev) to discuss your needs.

### Integrates with Docker image builds

If you use Depot for faster Docker image builds via our [remote container builds](/docs/container-builds/overview), your BuildKit builder runs right next to your managed GitHub Action runner, allowing for faster CI builds by mimizing network latency and data transfer.

### Integrates with Dagger Cloud

[Connect with Dagger Cloud](/docs/github-actions/integrations/dagger) and run your Dagger Engine builds on Depot's [Ultra Runners for GitHub Actions](/products/github-actions) with our accelerated cache enabled.

## Pricing

Depot-managed GitHub Action Runners are available on [all of our pricing plans](/pricing). Each plan includes a bucket of both Docker build minutes and GitHub Actions minutes. Business plan customers can [contact us](mailto:help@depot.dev) for custom plans.

#### Estimating your cost savings

You can estimate the potential cost savings by switching to Depot GitHub Action Runners by entering in your current usage by runner type on our [GitHub Actions Price calculator](/github-actions-price-calculator).

### Additional usage pricing for GitHub Actions minutes

The **Startup** and **Business** plans have the option to pay for additional GitHub Actions minutes on a per-minute basis. See the [runner type list](/docs/github-actions/runner-types) for the per-minute pricing for each runner type.

## Managing GitHub Actions Cache

Our **10x faster** Github Actions Cache implementation is billed at **$0.20 per GB of usage**. The usage is calculated by taking a snapshot every hour and then averaging out those snapshots over the course of the month.

### Cache retention policy

When using our GitHub Actions Cache, we store the cache entries in a distributed storage system that is optimized for high throughput and low latency. The cache storage is encrypted at rest and in transit. The **default retention policy** is that we store the cache entries for **14 days** and there is **no limit** on total cache size.

You can configure this retention policy in your Organization Settings to control time based retention and cache size limits.

**Available values for time based retention:** 7, 14 **(default)**, and 30 days

**Available values for size based retention:** 25GB, 50GB, 100GB, 150GB, 250GB, 500GB, No limit **(default)**

## Egress Filtering

Egress filtering allows you to control which external services your GitHub Actions runners can connect to.

### Configuration

You can configure egress rules in your organization's settings page under the **GitHub Actions Runners** section. Look for the **Egress Rules** subsection.

By default, Depot Runners will allow outbound connections to any external service. However, you can set the default rule, "`*`", to either `Deny` or `Allow` by default. You can also add specific rules to allow or deny connections to specific IPs, CIDRs, or hostnames.

Below is an example set of rules to get a docker build with golang working:

[![A screenshot of the egress filter rules settings in use](/images/egress-filter-rules.webp)](/images/egress-filter-rules.webp)

This example first applies a blanket deny rule, which blocks all outbound connections by default. Then, it allows connections to the following:

- `auth.docker.io` and `docker.io` for Docker Hub authentication and registry access
- `sum.golang.org` and `proxy.golang.org` for Go modules and proxy access
- `storage.googleapis.com` for Google Cloud Storage access

### Pre-configured rules

To ensure that runners can still connect to necessary services, we automatically add certain IPs and hosts to the allowlist:

- **depot.dev domains**
- **GitHub Actions service IPs**
- **AWS service IPs**

Additionally, `depot build` works out of the box with egress filtering enabled.

### Limitations

There are a few limitations to keep in mind when using egress filtering:

- Tailscale cannot be used together with egress filters because both modify network config in incompatible ways
- Any process that's given root access can modify the egress filter rules, so it's important to ensure that untrusted processes don't run with higher privileges than necessary.
- The egress filter currently isn't supported on macOS and Windows runners
