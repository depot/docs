ogTitle: Overview of Depot-managed GitHub Action Runners
description: Overview of Depot-managed GitHub Action Runners with 30% faster compute, 10x faster caching, and half the cost of GitHub hosted runners per minute.
---

Our fully-managed GitHub Actions Runners are a drop-in replacement for your existing runners in any GitHub Action jobs.

Our [Ultra Runner](/docs/github-actions/runner-types) is up to 3x faster than a GitHub-hosted runner. All runners are integrated into our cache orchestration system, so you get 10x faster caching without having to change anything in your jobs. We charge half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners, and we bill you by the second.

## Key features

### Single tenant

All builds run on ephemeral EC2 instances that are never reused. We launch a GitHub Actions runner in response to a webhook event from your organization requesting a runner for a job.

### Faster caching

Our runners are automatically integrated into our distributed cache architecture for upload and download speeds up to 1000 MiB/s on 12.5 Gbps of network throughput. We've brought 10x faster caching to GitHub Actions jobs by plugging in the same cache orchestration system that we use for our Docker image builds. You don't have to do anything to get this benefit; it's just there.

### Faster compute

Each runner is optimized for performance with our newest generation Ultra Runner that comes with a portion of memory reserved for disk. We launch with 4th Gen AMD EPYC Genoa CPUs for Intel runners and AWS Graviton2 CPUs for Arm runners.

### No limits

We don't enforce any concurrency limits, cache size limits, or network limits. You can run as many jobs as you want in parallel and we'll handle the rest.

### Per second billing

We track builds by the second and only bill for whole minutes used at the end of the month. We don't enforce a one minute minimum.

### Self-hostable

We can run our optimized runners in our cloud or your AWS account for additional security and compliance. We also support dedicated infrastructure and VPC peering options for something more custom to your needs.

### Integrates with Docker image builds

If you use Depot for faster Docker image builds via our [remote container builds](/docs/container-builds/overview), your BuildKit builder runs right next to your managed GitHub Action runner, allowing for faster CI builds by mimizing network latency and data transfer.

### Integrates with Dagger Cloud

[Connect with Dagger Cloud](/docs/github-actions/reference/dagger) and run your Dagger Engine builds on Depot's [Ultra Runners for GitHub Actions](/products/github-actions) with our accelerated cache enabled.

## Pricing

#### Runners

Depot-managed GitHub Action Runners are available on [all of our pricing plans](/pricing). Each plan includes a bucket of both Docker build minutes and GitHub Actions minutes. Business plan customers can [contact us](mailto:help@depot.dev) for custom plans.

|                                 | Developer | Startup                      |
| ------------------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------------- |
| Docker build minutes included   | 500       | 5,000 + $0.04/minute after   |
| GitHub Actions minutes included | 2,000     | 20,000 + $0.004/minute after |

Startup plans and above can pay for additional usage on a per minute basis for both Docker image builds and GitHub Actions minutes. For both types of minutes we charge on a per-minute basis, tracked per second. We only bill for whole minutes used at the end of the month.

### Additional usage pricing for GitHub Actions minutes

The **Startup** and **Business** plans have the option to pay for additional GitHub Actions minutes on a per-minute basis. See the [runner type list](/docs/github-actions/runner-types) for the per-minute pricing for each runner type.

#### Cache storage

Our **10x faster** Github Actions Cache implementation is billed at $0.20 per GB of usage. The usage is calculated by taking a snapshot every hour and then averaging out those snapshots over the course of the month.

To manage the cache storage, every day we evict any cache entries that have not been used in the past 14 days. We plan to add functionality to allow customers to tweak this number as needed in the future.
