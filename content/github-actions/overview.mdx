Depot GitHub Actions runners are a drop-in replacement for your existing runners in any GitHub Actions job. Our [runners](/docs/github-actions/runner-types) are up to 3x faster than a GitHub-hosted runner. Depot runners are integrated into our cache orchestration system, so you also get 10x faster caching without having to change anything in your jobs.

To use Depot runners, your repository must be owned by a GitHub organization (not a personal account).

## Switching to Depot

After you connect your Depot organization to your GitHub repository, switching to Depot is a one-line change to your runner label in your GitHub actions workflow file. For example:

```diff
jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
-    runs-on: ubuntu-24.04
+    runs-on: depot-ubuntu-24.04
    steps:
      ...
```

For a step-by-step guide, see the [quickstart](/docs/github-actions/quickstart).

## How Depot GitHub Actions runners work

Depot GitHub Actions runners use a webhook-driven architecture that launches ephemeral, single-tenant EC2 instances in response to your GitHub workflow jobs. When you run a GitHub Actions job with a Depot label (like `runs-on: depot-ubuntu-latest`), the job runs on a Depot runner.

When you start a workflow run in GitHub, the platform sends `workflow_job` webhook events to Depot's control plane. For each new job, Depot:

1. Receives the webhook event from GitHub indicating a new job needs to run.
2. Assigns a fresh EC2 instance from a pre-provisioned standby pool matching your requested runner type (for example, `depot-ubuntu-24.04`).
3. Registers the runner in your GitHub organization's default runner group.
4. Runs the entire job using GitHub's standard runner image on the instance.
5. Terminates the instance when the job completes.

### Integration with Docker image builds

Depot GitHub Actions runners and [Depot's remote container builds](/docs/container-builds/overview) run in the same private network. If you use Depot for Docker image builds (via `depot build`), your BuildKit builders run right next to your GitHub Actions runners, minimizing network latency and accelerating workflows that build images and load them back into the job for testing.

### Cache storage

When you use Depot GitHub Actions runners, we store the cache entries in a distributed storage system optimized for high throughput and low latency. The cache storage is encrypted at rest and in transit. To learn more and to configure the cache retention policy, see the [Depot Cache overview](/docs/cache/overview).

## Pricing

Runners usage is tracked by the second, with no one-minute minimum per run. We calculate total minutes used at the end of the billing period.

Plans also include [container build](/docs/container-builds/overview) minutes. See [Pricing](/pricing) for more about plan features and costs.

### Runner pricing by type and size

Larger runners consume your included GitHub Actions minutes faster (via multipliers) and cost more per minute. For per-minute pricing, see [GitHub Actions runner types](/docs/github-actions/runner-types).

### Additional GitHub Actions minutes

Startup and Business plan customers can pay for additional GitHub Actions minutes on a per-minute basis. For per-minute pricing, see [GitHub Actions runner types](/docs/github-actions/runner-types).

- Business plan: Custom minute allocation

Pricing is based on a per-minute basis, tracked per second, with no enforced one-minute minimum. See [Pricing](#pricing).

</FAQItem>

<FAQItem question="Can I use Depot's GitHub Actions runners with my existing workflows?">
  Yes, you can integrate our runners into your existing GitHub Actions workflows. You'll need to connect a GitHub
  organization-owned repository to Depot. Then change the `runs-on` label in your workflow file to use a Depot runner.
  See [Quickstart for GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/quickstart).
</FAQItem>

<FAQItem question="How does Depot's caching system work with GitHub Actions?">
  Our high-performance caching system is automatically integrated with our GitHub Actions runners. It provides up to 10x
  faster caching speeds compared to standard GitHub-hosted runners, with no need to change anything in your jobs. See
  [Use GitHub Actions cache with Depot Cache](/docs/cache/integrations/github-actions).
</FAQItem>

<FAQItem question="How can I track usage of Depot's GitHub Actions runners?">
  We provide detailed usage analytics for GitHub Actions on your organization's [usage page](/orgs/_/usage/) and on the
  [GitHub analytics page](/orgs/_/github-actions/analytics). You can track minutes used, job duration, and other
  metrics.
</FAQItem>

<FAQItem question="Can I use custom runner images with pre-installed software?">
  Yes, custom runner AMIs with pre-installed software are available on the Business plan. This is useful if you need specific tools, dependencies, or configurations that aren't included in our standard runner images.

With a custom runner AMI, we maintain a separate image specifically for your organization with your required software pre-installed. This can significantly reduce workflow execution time for dependencies that take time to install.

To request a custom runner AMI, [contact us](mailto:contact@depot.dev) with details about your requirements.
