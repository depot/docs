description: How to configure Dependabot to run dependency updates on Depot's optimized GitHub Actions runners
---

Depot GitHub Actions runners support running Dependabot jobs, allowing your dependency update workflows to benefit from the same performance improvements as your regular workflows.

## Overview

When Dependabot is configured to run on self-hosted runners, it can automatically use Depot runners for all dependency update jobs. This provides several benefits:

- **Faster dependency resolution** - Leverage Depot's optimized CPU and memory resources
- **Private registry access** - Access dependencies from private registries within your network (e.g. via [Tailscale](/docs/integrations/tailscale))
- **Consistent infrastructure** - Use the same high-performance runners for both regular workflows and dependency updates

## Setup

To enable Dependabot on Depot runners:

### 1. Enable Dependabot on self-hosted runners

Navigate to your repository or organization settings and enable "Dependabot on self-hosted runners". This setting allows Dependabot to use your configured self-hosted runners instead of GitHub's hosted runners.

For detailed instructions, see [GitHub's documentation on enabling self-hosted runners for Dependabot updates](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/maintain-dependencies/managing-dependabot-on-self-hosted-runners#enabling-self-hosted-runners-for-dependabot-updates).

### 2. Configure Depot runners

Ensure your organization is already configured to use Depot runners. If not, follow our [quickstart guide](/docs/github-actions/quickstart) to set up Depot runners with your organization.

### 3. Automatic routing

Once both settings are enabled, Dependabot jobs will automatically run on `depot-ubuntu-latest` runners. No additional configuration is required.
