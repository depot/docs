Welcome to Depot!

Depot is a build acceleration platform focused on making builds exponentially faster. You can use Depot to make everything run faster, from your Docker image build to your E2E test suite in GitHub Actions.

## What problem is Depot solving?

Slow builds suck, for everyone. They slow down your development process, force you to context switch to other tasks, and ultimately drain energy, happiness, and resources.

We are developers ourselves, and we've been frustrated with the constant pain of slow builds. The tools and providers of today simply don't prioritize performance. So, we built the solution we've always wanted, and that solution is Depot.

## Who is Depot for?

Depot is a good fit for any team that is tired of being bogged down by slow build performance. Whether you're a DevOps Engineer, Platform Engineer, Developer, Engineering Manager, or whatever awesome job title you have, Depot can help you make your builds faster.

## How does Depot work?

We have three products that can be used together or independently to make your builds more performant.

### Remote container builds

With Depot remote container builds we run an optimized version of BuildKit that can make your Docker image builds up to 40x faster. We support native multi-platform builds for both Intel & Arm without the need for emulation. We also provide a persistent shared cache that is instantly available across builds and shared across your team.

### GitHub Actions Runners

We offer Depot-managed GitHub Actions Runners that bring the power of Depot to the entire GitHub Actions workflow. We offer an optimized [Ultra Runner](/docs/github-actions/overview)) that is up to 3x faster than a GitHub-hosted runner. All runners are integrated into our cache orchestration system, so you get 10x faster caching without having to change anything in your jobs. Our runners are half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners, and we bill you by the second rather than by the minute.

### Build API

If you need to build container images from untrusted sources or simply want to be able to call an API to build an image, we offer our remote container build infrastructure behind an API. You can use our build API to build container images from your own code on behalf of your own users using our `depot` CLI or with `buildx` as a library.
