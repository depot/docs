## Welcome to Depot!

Depot makes your builds **up to 40x faster**. 

Depot is a build acceleration platform that transforms slow, frustrating build processes into lightning-fast workflows that keep you in flow instead of waiting around.

![Build speed comparison: Slow vs. fast builds with Depot acceleration](/content/assets/slow-vs-fast.svg)

Whether you're building Docker images, running CI/CD pipelines, or developing locally, Depot gives you back hours of productive time every week by making your builds run exponentially faster.

## The build speed problem killing productivity

Slow builds don't just waste time – they destroy productivity and happiness. Waiting minutes or hours for builds forces constant context switching, breaks flow state, and turns what should be quick iterations into frustrating delays.

At Depot, we're developers ourselves, and we've lived this frustration. Watching CI pipelines crawl through test suites, waiting for Docker builds to complete, dealing with complex caching setups across different tools – modern development infrastructure simply doesn't prioritize the performance that teams need to move fast.

Depot is the build acceleration platform we've always wanted: Exponentially faster workflows with minimal setup.

## Who benefits from Depot

**Any team tired of waiting** can use Depot to move faster:

- **DevOps engineers** optimizing CI/CD pipeline performance.
- **Platform engineers** building faster developer experiences.  
- **Software developers** who want lightning-fast local builds.
- **Engineering managers** looking to improve team velocity and reduce infrastructure costs.
- **Any team** that builds containers or runs automated workflows.

## How Depot accelerates your entire workflow

We offer five integrated products that work together or independently to eliminate build bottlenecks across your development process.

### Supercharged Docker builds that finish in seconds

Replace `docker build` with `depot build` for **up to 40x faster** container builds. 

Depot runs an optimized version of BuildKit with native multi-platform support for Intel and ARM (no slow emulation), persistent shared caching across your team, and powerful remote infrastructure that frees up your local machine.

**Perfect for:** Teams building containers locally or in CI/CD.

### Global container registry with CDN speed

Depot Registry delivers container images instantly anywhere applications deploy. 

Depot's globally-distributed registry with CDN-backed delivery reduces pull times and integrates seamlessly with remote builds — push and pull without any additional configuration.

**Perfect for:** Teams deploying containers globally.

### GitHub Actions runners that cost half as much and run 3x faster

Get **3x faster GitHub Actions runners** with 30% faster CPUs, 10x faster networking and caching, unrestricted concurrency, and **true per-second billing** at half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners. 

Depot runners integrate with the cache system automatically — no workflow changes needed for dramatically faster caching.

**Perfect for:** Teams using GitHub Actions for CI/CD.

### Universal build cache for every tool

Share build artifacts and test results across your entire team with high-performance remote caching for **Bazel, Go, Gradle, Turborepo, sccache, and Pants**. Make every build incremental and achieve 2x to 20x speed improvements. The cache works instantly from local development or any CI provider, with automatic integration with Depot GitHub Actions Runners.

**Perfect for:** Teams using multiple build tools who want shared caching.

### Depot Build API for platforms that build for users

Build container images programmatically for your customers using Depot's secure, isolated infrastructure. Access Depot's entire build system through gRPC, Connect, and HTTP/JSON APIs, with SDKs available for easy integration.

**Perfect for:** Platforms that build containers for their users.
