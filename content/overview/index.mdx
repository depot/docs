Welcome to Depot!

Depot is a build acceleration platform focused on making builds radically more efficient and performant. We have three products that are available on **all pricing plans**:

1. **[Remote container builds](/docs/container-builds/overview)** — our remote container build service can build Docker images up to 40x faster
2. **[GitHub Actions Runners](/docs/github-actions/overview)** — fully-managed GitHub Actions runners with 30% faster compute, 10x faster caching, and half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners
3. **[Depot Build API](/docs/api/overview)** - we offer all of our performance for container image builds behind a public API so that you can build container images from your own code on behalf of your own users

## Key Features

Depot makes your builds faster with as little additional configuration as possible. The overarching philosophy is to meet you where you're already building and give you tools & compute tailored to making your builds as fast as possible.

There are a few key Depot features worth knowing about:

### Build isolation & acceleration

All builds run on ephemeral EC2 instances optimized for their specific use case, such as Docker image builds for our [remote container builds service](/docs/container-builds/overview) or GitHub Actions jobs for our [managed GitHub Actions runners](/docs/github-actions/overview).

Builders are spun up on demand and terminated when the build is complete, so you only pay for the compute you use. Builders are never shared across Depot customers or projects. We've optimized our builders and provisioning system to start a given build as quickly as possible, typically under 10 seconds.

Our fast Docker image builders have 16 CPUs with 32 GB of memory and a default NVMe SSD of 50GB (configurable up to 500GB).

Our GitHub Actions runners can be configured to run on the default runner type of 2 CPUs, up to 32 CPUs for both Intel & Arm runners.

### Persistent shared caching

We have built a cache orchestration architecture designed to make your builds as fast as possible.

We automatically persist your Docker layer cache to fast NVMe storage and make it instantly available across builds. The layer cache is also shared across your entire team with access to the same project, so you can also benefit from your team's work.

For our GitHub Actions runners, we've brought 10x faster caching to GitHub Actions jobs by plugging in the same cache orchestration system that we use for our Docker image builds. You don't have to do anything to get this benefit; it's just there.

### Multiple platforms

We support native multi-platform Docker image builds with **zero emulation.** We build Docker images for both Intel & Arm without the need for `qemu` or any other emulation. We build Intel images on fast Xeon Scalable Ice Lake CPUs and Arm images on AWS Graviton3 CPUs.

We also support Intel & Arm runners with our managed GitHub Actions Runners. You can run any given job on either by specifying the architecture in your [GitHub Actions `runs-on` label.](/docs/github-actions/quickstart#depot-supported-labels)

### Drop-in replacement

Using Depot for your Docker image builds is as straightforward as replacing your `docker build` command with `depot build`. We support all the same flags and options as `docker build`, and we've added a few features behind the scenes to make your build faster.

To use our GitHub Actions Runners, you can add a label to your GitHub Actions job to run it on our runners. We support all the same features as GitHub-hosted runners, but with better performance like 1 GB/s networks, 10x faster caching, and 30% faster compute.

### CI & Dev tool integrations

We have extensive integrations with most major CI providers and developer tools to make it easy to use Depot in your existing workflows. To see how to get faster Docker image builds with Depot in your CI provider, check out our [CI provider docs.](/docs/guides/continuous-integration)

For more information on how to use Depot with developer tools like Docker, Dev Containers, and Docker Compose, check out any of the docs below:

- [How to use Depot in local development](/docs/guides/local-development)
- [How to use Depot with Docker & Docker Compose](/docs/guides/docker-build)
- [How to use Depot with Dev Containers](/docs/guides/devcontainers)

### OIDC integrations

For our [remote container builds service](/docs/container-builds/overview), we support OIDC trust relationships with GitHub, CircleCI, Buildkite, and Mint so that you don't need any static access tokens in your CI provider to leverage Depot. You can learn more about configuring a trust relationship in our [authentication docs.](/docs/cli/authentication)

### Ephemeral Registry

Our remote container builds service comes with a built-in ephemeral registry that you can use to save the images from your `depot build` and `depot bake` commands to a temporary registry. You can then pull those images back down or push them onto your final registry as you see fit. You can read more in our [ephemeral registry guide.](/docs/guides/ephemeral-registry)

## Next steps

Once you [sign up for an account](/start), getting started with Depot is relatively straightforward.
