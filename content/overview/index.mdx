# Welcome to Depot!

Depot makes your builds **up to 40x faster**. We're a build acceleration platform that transforms slow, frustrating build processes into lightning-fast workflows that keep you in flow state instead of waiting around.

![Performance comparison](/content/assets/slow-vs-fast.svg)

Whether you're building Docker images, running CI/CD pipelines, or developing locally, we'll give you back hours of productive time every week by making everything run exponentially faster.

## The build speed problem that's draining your team

Slow builds don't just waste time — they destroy productivity and happiness. Waiting minutes or hours for builds forces constant context switching, breaks flow state, and turns what should be quick iterations into frustrating delays.

We're developers ourselves, and we've lived this frustration. Watching CI pipelines crawl through test suites, waiting for Docker builds to complete, dealing with complex caching setups across different tools — modern development infrastructure simply doesn't prioritize the performance that teams need to move fast.

That's why we built Depot: the build acceleration platform we've always wanted.

## Who benefits from Depot

**Any team tired of waiting** can use Depot to move faster:

- **DevOps Engineers** optimizing CI/CD pipeline performance
- **Platform Engineers** building faster developer experiences  
- **Software Developers** who want lightning-fast local builds
- **Engineering Managers** looking to improve team velocity and reduce infrastructure costs
- **Any team** that builds containers or runs automated workflows

## How Depot accelerates your entire workflow

We offer five integrated products that work together or independently to eliminate build bottlenecks across your development process.

### Supercharged Docker builds that finish in seconds

Replace `docker build` with `depot build` for **up to 40x faster** container builds. We run an optimized version of BuildKit with native multi-platform support for Intel and ARM (no slow emulation), persistent shared caching across your team, and powerful remote infrastructure that frees up your local machine.

**Perfect for:** Teams building containers locally or in CI/CD

[Learn more about remote container builds →](/docs/container-builds/overview)

### Global container registry with CDN speed

Depot Registry delivers your container images instantly anywhere your applications deploy. Our globally-distributed registry with CDN-backed delivery reduces pull times and integrates seamlessly with our remote builds — push and pull without any additional configuration.

**Perfect for:** Teams deploying containers globally

### GitHub Actions runners that cost half as much and run 3x faster

Get **3x faster GitHub Actions runners** with 30% faster CPUs, 10x faster networking and caching, unrestricted concurrency, and **true per-second billing** at half the cost of GitHub-hosted runners. Our runners integrate with our cache system automatically — no workflow changes needed for dramatically faster caching.

**Perfect for:** Teams using GitHub Actions for CI/CD

[Learn more about GitHub Actions Runners →](/docs/github-actions/overview)

### Universal build cache for every tool you use

Share build artifacts and test results across your entire team with high-performance remote caching for **Bazel, Go, Gradle, Turborepo, sccache, and Pants**. Make every build incremental and achieve 2x to 20x speed improvements. The cache works instantly from local development, any CI provider, and integrates automatically with our GitHub Actions runners.

**Perfect for:** Teams using multiple build tools and wanting shared caching

### Build API for platforms building on behalf of users

Build container images programmatically for your customers using our secure, isolated infrastructure. Access our entire build system through gRPC, Connect, and HTTP/JSON APIs, with SDKs available for easy integration.

**Perfect for:** Platforms that need to build containers for their users
