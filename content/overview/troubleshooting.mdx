This page provides an overview of troubleshooting resources for Depot products.

## Container builds

If you're having issues with Docker image builds using Depot, see the [container builds troubleshooting guide](/docs/container-builds/troubleshooting).

## Billing

### Payment failures and retries

Payment failures usually occur because of insufficient funds, expired cards, or temporary issues with your payment provider.

When a payment fails, we automatically retry the charge over the course of 14 days. You'll receive an email notification after each failed attempt.

**How to resolve**

If you receive a payment failure notification:

1. Check that your payment method has sufficient funds
2. Verify that your card hasn't expired
3. Update your payment information through the link in the payment failure email
4. Contact your bank if you suspect the charge was blocked

If all retry attempts fail, your subscription will be automatically canceled to prevent further charges. You can reactivate your subscription at any time by updating your payment method and contacting our support team.

If you're experiencing repeated payment failures or need help updating your payment information, reach out to support and we'll help get your subscription sorted.
