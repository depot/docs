# CLI Reference

Below is a reference to the `depot` CLI, including all config, commands, flags, and options. To submit an issue or features please see our CLI repo over on [GitHub](https://github.com/depot/cli).

## Specifying a Depot project

Some commands need to know which [project](/docs/core-concepts#projects) to route the build to.

For interactive terminals calling [`build`](#depot-build) or [`bake`](#depot-bake), if don't specify a project, you will be prompted to choose a project when using an interactive prompt and given the option to save that project for future use in a `depot.json` file.

Alternatively, you can specify the Depot project for any command using any of the following methods:

1. Use the `--project` flag with the ID of the project you want to use
2. Set the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable to the ID of the project you want to use

## Commands

### `depot bake`

The `bake` command allows you to define all of your build targets in a central file, either HCL, JSON, or Compose. You can then pass that file to the `bake` command and Depot will build all of the target images with all of their options (i.e. platforms, tags, build arguments, etc.).

By default, `depot bake` will leave the built image in the remote builder cache. If you would like to download the image to your local Docker daemon (for instance, to `docker run` the result), you can use the `--load` flag.

Alternatively, to push the image to a remote registry directly from the builder instance, you can use the `--push` flag.

**Example**

An example `docker-bake.hcl` file:

```hcl
group "default" {
  targets = ["original", "db"]
}

target "original" {
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  platforms = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  tags = ["example/app:test"]
}

target "db" {
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile.db"
  platforms = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  tags = ["example/db:test"]
}
```

To build all of the images we just need to call `bake`:

```shell
depot bake -f docker-bake.hcl
```

If you want to build a specific target in the bake file, you can specify it in the `bake` command:

```shell
depot bake -f docker-bake.hcl original
```

#### Flags for `bake`

This command accepts all the command line flags as Docker's `docker buildx bake` command.

### `depot build`

Runs a Docker build using Depot's remote builder infrastructure.

By default, `depot build` will leave the built image in the remote builder cache. If you would like to download the image to your local Docker daemon (for instance, to `docker run` the result), you can use the `--load` flag.

Alternatively, to push the image to a remote registry directly from the builder instance, you can use the `--push` flag.

**Example**

```shell
# Build remotely
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

```shell
# Build remotely, download the container locally
depot build -t repo/image:tag . --load
```

```shell
# Lint your dockerfile
depot build -t repo/image:tag . --lint
```

```shell
# Build remotely, push to a registry
depot build -t repo/image:tag . --push
```

### `depot cache`

Interact with the cache associated with a Depot project. The `cache` command consists of subcommands for each operation.

#### `depot cache reset`

Reset the cache of the Depot project to force a new empty cache volume to be created.

**Example**

Reset the cache of the current project ID in the root `depot.json`

```shell
depot cache reset .
```

Reset the cache of a specific project ID

```shell
depot cache reset --project 12345678910
```

### `depot configure-docker`

Configure Docker to use Depot's remote builder infrastructure. This command installs Depot as a Docker CLI plugin (i.e., `docker depot ...`), sets the Depot plugin as the default Docker builder (i.e., `docker build`), and activates a buildx driver (i.e. `docker buildx buildx ...`).

```shell
depot configure-docker
```

If you want to uninstall the plugin, you can specify the `--uninstall` flag.

```shell
depot configure-docker --uninstall
```

### `depot list`

Interact with Depot projects and builds.

#### `depot list projects`

Display an interactive listing of current Depot projects. Selecting a specific project will display the latest builds.
To return from the latest builds to projects, press `ESC`.

To exit type `q` or `ctrl+c`

**Example**

```shell
depot list projects
```

### `depot list builds`

Display the latest Depot builds for a project. By default the command runs an interactive listing of depot builds showing status and build duration.

To exit type `q` or `ctrl+c`

**Example**

List builds for the project in the current directory.

```shell
depot list builds
```

**Example**

List builds for a specific project ID

```shell
depot list builds --project 12345678910
```

**Example**

The list command can output build information to stdout with the `--output` option. It supports `json` and `csv`.

Output builds in JSON for the project in the current directory.

```shell
depot list builds --output json
```

### `depot init`

Initialize an existing Depot project in the current directory. The CLI will display an interactive list of your Depot projects for you to choose from, then write a `depot.json` file in the current directory with the contents `{"id": "PROJECT_ID"}`.

**Example**

```shell
depot init
```

### `depot login`

Authenticates with your Depot account, automatically creating and storing a user token on your local machine.

**Example**

```shell
depot login
```

### `depot logout`

Logout out of your Depot account, removing your user token from your local machine.

**Example**

```shell
depot logout
```

### `depot pull`

Pull an image from the ephemeral registry by build ID in a project.

**Example**

```shell
depot pull --project <project-id> <build-id>
```

You can also specify the tag to assign to the image using the `-t` flag.

**Example**

```shell
depot pull --project <project-id> -t <image-name>:<tag> <build-id>
```

There is also the option to pull an image for a specific platform.

```shell
depot pull --project <project-id> --platform linux/arm64 <build-id>
```

#### Flags for `pull`

Additional flags that can be used with this command.

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}
| Name | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `platform` | Pulls image for specific platform ("linux/amd64", "linux/arm64") |
| `progress` | Set type of progress output ("auto", "plain", "tty", "quiet") (default "auto") |
| `project` | Depot project ID |
| `tag` | Optional tags to apply to the image |
| `token` | Depot token |
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

### `depot push`

Push an image from the ephemeral registry to a remote registry. It uses registry credentials stored in Docker when pushing to registries. If you have not already authenticated with your registry, you should do so with `docker login` before running `depot push`.

**Example**

```shell
depot push --project <project-id> <build-id>
```

You can also specify the tag to assign to the image that is being pushed by using the `-t` flag.

**Example**

```shell
depot psuh --project <project-id> -t <image-name>:<tag> <build-id>
```

#### Flags for `push`

Additional flags that can be used with this command.

| `project` | Depot project ID |
| `tag` | Optional tags to apply to the image |
| `token` | Depot token |
{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}
