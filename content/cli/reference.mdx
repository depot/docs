---

Below is a reference to the `depot` CLI, including all config, commands, flags, and options. To submit an issue or features please see our CLI repo over on [GitHub](https://github.com/depot/cli).

## Specifying a Depot project

Some commands need to know which [project](/docs/core-concepts#projects) to route the build to.

For interactive terminals calling [`build`](#depot-build) or [`bake`](#depot-bake), if don't specify a project, you will be prompted to choose a project when using an interactive prompt and given the option to save that project for future use in a `depot.json` file.

Alternatively, you can specify the Depot project for any command using any of the following methods:

1. Use the `--project` flag with the ID of the project you want to use
2. Set the `DEPOT_PROJECT_ID` environment variable to the ID of the project you want to use

## Authentication

The Depot CLI supports different authentication mechanisms based on where you're running your build, you can read more about them in our [authentication docs](/docs/cli/authentication).

### Local builds with the CLI

For the CLI running locally, you can use the `depot login` command to authenticate with your Depot account, and the `depot logout` command to log out. This will generate a [user token](/docs/cli/authentication#user-access-tokens) and store it on your local machine. We recommended only using this option when running builds locally.

### Build with the CLI in a CI environment

When using the CLI in a CI environment like GitHub Actions, we recommended configuring your workflows to leverage our [OIDC trust relationships](/docs/cli/authentication#oidc-trust-relationships). These prevent the need to store user tokens in your CI environment and allow you to authenticate with Depot using your CI provider's identity.

For CI providers that don't support OIDC, we recommended configuring your CI environment to use a [project token](/docs/cli/authentication#project-tokens).

### The `--token` flag

A variety of Depot CLI calls accept a `--token` flag, which allows you to specify a **user or project token** to use for the command. If no token is specified, the CLI will attempt to use the token stored on your local machine or look for an environment variable called `DEPOT_TOKEN`.

## Commands

### `depot bake`

The `bake` command allows you to define all of your build targets in a central file, either HCL, JSON, or Compose. You can then pass that file to the `bake` command and Depot will build all of the target images with all of their options (i.e. platforms, tags, build arguments, etc.).

By default, `depot bake` will leave the built image in the remote builder cache. If you would like to download the image to your local Docker daemon (for instance, to `docker run` the result), you can use the `--load` flag. In some cases it is more efficient to load from the registry, so this may result in the build getting saved to the Depot Registry.

Alternatively, to push the image to a remote registry directly from the builder instance, you can use the `--push` flag.

**Example**

An example `docker-bake.hcl` file:

```hcl
group "default" {
  targets = ["original", "db"]
}

target "original" {
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  platforms = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  tags = ["example/app:test"]
}

target "db" {
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile.db"
  platforms = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  tags = ["example/db:test"]
}
```

To build all of the images we just need to call `bake`:

```shell
depot bake -f docker-bake.hcl
```

If you want to build different targets in the bake file with different Depot projects, you can specify the `project_id` in the `target` block:

```hcl
group "default" {
  targets = ["original", "db"]
}

target "original" {
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile"
  platforms = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  tags = ["example/app:test"]
  project_id = "project-id-1"
}

target "db" {
  dockerfile = "Dockerfile.db"
  platforms = ["linux/amd64", "linux/arm64"]
  tags = ["example/db:test"]
  project_id = "project-id-2"
}
```

If you want to build a specific target in the bake file, you can specify it in the `bake` command:

```shell
depot bake -f docker-bake.hcl original
```

You can also save all of the targets built in a bake or compose file to the [Depot Registry](/docs/registry/overview) for later use with the `--save` flag:

```shell
depot bake -f docker-bake.hcl --save
```

#### Docker Compose support

Depot supports using bake to build [Docker Compose](/blog/depot-with-docker-compose) files.

To use `depot bake` with a Docker Compose file, you can specify the file with the `-f` flag:

```shell
depot bake -f docker-compose.yml
```

Compose files have special extensions prefixed with `x-` to give additional information to the build process.

In this example, the `x-bake` extension is used to specify the tags for each service and the `x-depot` extension is used to specify different project IDs for each.

```yaml
services:
  mydb:
    build:
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile.db
      x-bake:
        tags:
          - ghcr.io/myorg/mydb:latest
          - ghcr.io/myorg/mydb:v1.0.0
      x-depot:
        project-id: 1234567890
  myapp:
    build:
      dockerfile: ./Dockerfile.app
      x-bake:
        tags:
          - ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:latest
          - ghcr.io/myorg/myapp:v1.0.0
      x-depot:
        project-id: 9876543210
```

### `depot build`

Runs a Docker build using Depot's remote builder infrastructure.

By default, `depot build` will leave the built image in the remote builder cache. If you would like to download the image to your local Docker daemon (for instance, to `docker run` the result), you can use the `--load` flag. In some cases it is more efficient to load from the registry, so this may result in the build getting saved to the Depot Registry.

Alternatively, to push the image to a remote registry directly from the builder instance, you can use the `--push` flag.

**Example**

```shell
# Build remotely
depot build -t repo/image:tag .
```

```shell
# Build remotely, download the container locally
depot build -t repo/image:tag . --load
```

```shell
# Lint your dockerfile
depot build -t repo/image:tag . --lint
```

```shell
# Build remotely, push to a registry
depot build -t repo/image:tag . --push

### `depot cache`

Interact with the cache associated with a Depot project. The `cache` command consists of subcommands for each operation.

#### `depot cache reset`

Reset the cache of the Depot project to force a new empty cache volume to be created.

**Example**

Reset the cache of the current project ID in the root `depot.json`

```shell
depot cache reset .
```

Reset the cache of a specific project ID

```shell
depot cache reset --project 12345678910
```

### `depot claude`

Run Claude Code in remote agent sandboxes backed by Depot with automatic session & file system saving and resuming. Sessions are stored by Depot and can be resumed by session ID, allowing you to collaborate on any session in your organization across any environment.

By default, Claude Code runs in a remote sandbox environment.

Note: All flags not recognized by `depot` are passed directly through to the Claude CLI. This includes Claude flags like `-p`, `--model`, etc.

**Example**

Start a new Claude Code session with a custom ID:

```shell
depot claude --session-id feature-auth-redesign
```

Resume an existing session:

```shell
depot claude --resume feature-auth-redesign
```

Run Claude Code locally instead of in a sandbox:

Note: This will only persist the Claude Code session information up to Depot, but not execute in a remote sandbox.

```shell
depot claude --local --session-id local-development
```

Work with a Git repository in the sandbox:

```shell
depot claude --repository https://github.com/user/repo.git --branch main --session-id repo-work
```

Use a private repository with authentication:

Note: You can use the `--git-secret` flag to specify a secret containing your Git credentials, or use the `Depot Code` app installed in your GitHub organization.

```shell
depot claude secrets add GITHUB_TOKEN
depot claude --repository https://github.com/org/private-repo.git --git-secret GITHUB_TOKEN
```

Mix Depot flags with Claude flags:

```shell
depot claude --session-id older-claude-pr-9953 --model claude-3-opus-20240229 -p "write tests"
```

Use in a script with piped input:

```shell
cat code.py | depot claude -p "review this code" --session-id code-review
```

#### `depot claude secrets add`

Add a new secret to your organization. You'll be prompted to enter the secret value securely.

**Example**

```shell
# Add a secret interactively
depot claude secrets add GITHUB_TOKEN

# Add a secret with value (use with caution)
depot claude secrets add API_KEY --value "secret-value"
```

#### `depot claude secrets list`

List all secrets in your organization. Note that secret values are never displayed.

### `depot gocache`

Configure Go tools to use Depot Cache. The Go tools will use the remote cache service to store and retrieve build artifacts.

_Note: This requires Go 1.24 or later._

Set the environment variable `GOCACHEPROG` to `depot gocache` to configure Go to use Depot Cache.

```shell
export GOCACHEPROG='depot gocache'
```

Next, run your Go build commands as usual.

```shell
go build ./...
```

To set verbose output, add the --verbose option:

```shell
export GOCACHEPROG='depot gocache --verbose'
```

To clean the cache, you can use the typical `go clean` workflow:

```shell
go clean -cache
```

If you are in multiple Depot organizations and want to specify the organization, you can use the `--organization` flag.

```shell
export GOCACHEPROG='depot gocache --organization ORG_ID'
```

### `depot configure-docker`

Configure Docker to use Depot's remote builder infrastructure. This command installs Depot as a Docker CLI plugin (i.e., `docker depot ...`), sets the Depot plugin as the default Docker builder (i.e., `docker build`), and activates a buildx driver (i.e. `docker buildx buildx ...`).

```shell
depot configure-docker
```

If you want to uninstall the plugin, you can specify the `--uninstall` flag.

```shell
depot configure-docker --uninstall
```

### `depot list`

Interact with Depot builds.

### `depot list builds`

Display the latest Depot builds for a project. By default the command runs an interactive listing of depot builds showing status and build duration.

To exit type `q` or `ctrl+c`

**Example**

List builds for the project in the current directory.

```shell
depot list builds
```

**Example**

List builds for a specific project ID

```shell
depot list builds --project 12345678910
```

**Example**

The list command can output build information to stdout with the `--output` option. It supports `json` and `csv`.

Output builds in JSON for the project in the current directory.

```shell
depot list builds --output json
```

### `depot init`

Initialize an existing Depot project in the current directory. The CLI will display an interactive list of your Depot projects for you to choose from, then write a `depot.json` file in the current directory with the contents `{"id": "PROJECT_ID"}`.

**Example**

```shell
depot init
```

### `depot login`

Authenticates with your Depot account, automatically creating and storing a user token on your local machine.

**Examples**

```shell
# Login and select organization interactively
$ depot login

# Login and specify organization ID
$ depot login --org-id 1234567890

# Clear existing token before logging in
$ depot login --clear
```

### `depot logout`

Logout out of your Depot account, removing your user token from your local machine.

**Example**

```shell
depot logout
```

### `depot projects create`

Create a new project in your Depot organization.

```shell
depot projects create "your-project-name"
```

Projects will be created with the default region `us-east-1` and cache storage policy of 50 GB per architecture. You can specify a different region and cache storage policy using the `--region` and `--cache-storage-policy` flags.

```shell
depot projects create --region eu-central-1 --cache-storage-policy 100 "your-project-name"
```

If you are in more than one organization, you can specify the ID of the organization you want the project to be created in using the `--organization` flag.

```shell
depot projects create ---organization 12345678910 "your-project-name"
```

### `depot push`

Push an image from the Depot Registry to another registry. It uses registry credentials stored in Docker when pushing to registries. If you have not already authenticated with your registry, you should do so with `docker login` before running `depot push`.

Alternatively, you can specify the environment variables `DEPOT_PUSH_REGISTRY_USERNAME` and `DEPOT_PUSH_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`
for the registry credentials. This allows you to skip the `docker login` step.

**Example**

```shell
depot push --project <project-id> <build-id>
```

You can also specify the tag to assign to the image that is being pushed by using the `-t` flag.

**Examples**

```shell
# Switch to a specific organization by ID
$ depot org switch 1234567890

# Select organization interactively
$ depot org switch
```

#### `depot org show`

Show the current organization set in your global Depot settings.

**Usage**

```shell
depot org show
```

**Example**

```shell
$ depot org show
1234567890

## FAQ

### How can I minimize build output for CI or automated environments?

If you want cleaner, less verbose output from Depot builds (especially useful in CI pipelines or scripts), you can set the `DEPOT_NO_SUMMARY_LINK` environment variable to suppress various informational messages including:

- Build summary links and URLs
- New release update notifications  
- Bake save/push instructions

**Example:**

```shell
export DEPOT_NO_SUMMARY_LINK=1
depot build .
```

You can also use the `--progress=quiet` flag on individual commands for minimal output:

```shell
depot build --progress=quiet .
```
