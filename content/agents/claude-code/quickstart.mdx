This guide will help you get started with Depot's remote agent sandboxes for running Claude Code agents. With Depot, you can run your coding agents in a secure, isolated environment in the cloud, allowing you to move your coding sessions off of your local machine and into fast remote environments where you can easily launch, resume, and share coding sessions.

## 1. Install the `depot` CLI

Before you can start running remote agents, you need to install the Depot CLI. The CLI is available for Mac and Linux.

**Note:** Remote agent sandboxes are only available on `depot` CLI version 2.96.2 or later.

For Mac, you can install the CLI with Homebrew:

```shell
brew install depot/tap/depot
```

For Linux, you can install the CLI with [our installation script](https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh):

```shell
# Install the latest version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh

# Install a specific version
curl -L https://depot.dev/install-cli.sh | sh -s 2.96.2
```

For all other platforms, you can download the binary directly from [the latest release](https://github.com/depot/cli/releases).

## 2. Creating a Depot organization

Claude Code agent sandboxes and sandbox secrets live under a Depot organization. So before you can launch your first agent sandbox, you need to create a Depot organization.

![Create a Depot organization](/images/docs/depot-create-organization.webp)

1. Login to your Depot account to get to your [list of organizations](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Create Organization` button
3. Enter an organization name
4. Click `Create organization`

## 3. Get your Anthropic credentials

Today Depot only supports bringing your own Anthropic subscription or API key. We do not provide our own Anthropic API key for use with Depot's remote agent sandboxes.

There are two options for configuring your Anthropic credentials to use with Depot's remote agent sandboxes.

### Claude Code token for Max plan

**This is our recommended method for using Claude Code with Depot's remote agent sandboxes.**

If you're on the **Max plan** from Anthropic, you need to get your Claude Code OAuth token to use with Depot's remote agent sandboxes.

First, using the `claude` CLI, you can generate a new OAuth token:

```shell
claude setup-token
```

This will output a token that you can copy and use in the next step.

### Anthropic API key

Alternatively, you can generate an Anthropic API key by following their [Developer Platform](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/api/overview) documentation.

## 4. Set your Anthropic credentials

For Depot to use your Anthropic credentials for remote Claude Code agents, you need to configure a secret in your Depot organization for your Anthropic API key or OAuth token.

### Max plan subscribers (OAuth token)

If you generated a Claude Code OAuth token, you can set it as a secret in your Depot organization:

```shell
depot claude secrets add CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN --value <your-token-from-step-3>
```

### Anthropic API key

If you generated an Anthropic API key, you can set it as a secret in your Depot organization:

```shell
depot claude secrets add ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --value <your-anthropic-api-key-from-step-3>
```

## 5. Access your git repositories

You can work with public and private git repositories in your remote agent sandboxes. If you want to use private git repositories, you need to either install the `Depot Code` app into your GitHub organization, or set your Git credentials as secrets in your Depot organization.

### Install the Depot Code app into your GitHub organization

To grant remote agent sandboxes access to your private GitHub repositories, you can install the `Depot Code` app into your GitHub organization. This will allow you to clone and push changes to your private repositories from within your remote agent sandboxes.

![Install Depot Code app](/images/docs/depot-code-github-app.webp)

1. Login to your Depot account and [select your organization](/orgs)
2. Click on the `Settings` tab in the sidebar
3. Scroll down to the `GitHub Code Access` section
4. Click `Connect to GitHub`

### Granting access outside of GitHub

If you prefer not to use the Depot Code app, you can set your Git credentials as secrets in your Depot organization. This allows you to clone and push changes to your private repositories using your Git credentials.

To set your Git credentials as secrets, run the following commands:

```shell
depot claude secrets add GIT_CREDENTIALS --value <your-key>
```

## 6. Launch your first remote agent sandbox

Once you've configured your Anthropic credentials and Git access, you can launch your first remote agent sandbox using the `depot claude` command.

```shell
depot claude
  --session-id feature-auth \
  --repository https://github.com/foo/bar \
  --branch main \
  "Give me a general summary of this repository"

âœ“ Claude sandbox started!
  Session ID: 557737f9-6274-4df0-ac78-fda2122b6180
  Link: https://depot.dev/orgs/12293423849/claude/9842347238947
```

This command immediately tells the Depot control plane to start a new agent sandbox for Claude Code. Returning a url to the session inside of Depot where you can follow the output.

And that's it! You now have your Depot organization set up to make use of Depot agent sandboxes for Claude Code. You can pass different git repositories that your git credentials or Depot Code app have access to, you can specify different branches, you can resume a session using the `--resume` flag, and you can fork new sessions from an existing file systems using the `--session-id` flag and `--resume` flag at the same time.
